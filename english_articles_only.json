    "body": "More than 6,000 people were killed during a three-day offensive by Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the Darfur city of El-Fasher in late October, the United Nations said in a report released Friday.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office described the assault as a wave of violence “shocking in its scale and brutality,” citing widespread killings, executions, sexual violence, abductions, torture and enforced disappearances that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nAccording to the report, RSF fighters and allied Arab militias overran El-Fasher — the Sudanese army’s last major stronghold in Darfur — on Oct. 26 after an 18-month siege. At least 4,400 people were killed inside the city between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27, while more than 1,600 others died as they tried to flee.\n\nThe findings were based on interviews with 140 victims and witnesses, supported by satellite imagery and video analysis. The report warned the actual toll was likely “significantly higher.”\n\nIt said around 500 people were killed when heavy weapons were fired at civilians sheltering in a university dormitory, while about 600 others — including dozens of children — were executed in university facilities on the same day.\n\nThe report also cited separate attacks, including the killing of at least 460 people when RSF fighters stormed a maternity hospital on Oct. 28, and about 300 deaths in shelling and drone strikes on a displaced persons’ camp earlier that week.\n\nSexual violence was described as widespread, with women and girls from non-Arab communities particularly targeted. Survivors told investigators that rape and gang rape were systematically used as a weapon of war.\n\nThousands were reportedly abducted or detained in facilities run by the RSF, including a children’s hospital converted into a detention center, with many people still missing.\n\nUN rights chief Volker Türk called for accountability, warning that continued impunity risks fueling further cycles of violence in Sudan’s ongoing conflict, which began in April 2023 and has triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.",

    "title": "Europe says Russia killed opposition leader Alexei Navalny using dart frog toxin",
    "body": "Five European nations have concluded that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a rare toxin derived from poison dart frogs, escalating accusations against the Kremlin over his death.\n\nForeign ministries of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said laboratory analysis of samples taken from Navalny’s body found the presence of epibatidine, a potent neurotoxin naturally secreted by dart frogs in South America but also capable of being manufactured synthetically.\n\nIn a joint statement, the countries said Russia had the “means, motive and opportunity” to administer the poison and announced plans to report Moscow to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for an alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nNavalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critic, died on Feb 16, 2024, in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence he said was politically motivated. Russian authorities have maintained that he died of natural causes, denying any involvement.\n\nHis widow, Yulia Navalnaya, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said she had been convinced from the outset that her husband was poisoned and that new findings now provided proof. She again accused Putin of being responsible and called for accountability.\n\nEuropean officials said epibatidine affects the nervous system in a manner similar to nerve agents, causing breathing difficulties, seizures, slowed heart rate and potentially death. They expressed high confidence in the findings but acknowledged the investigation was complex and time-consuming.\n\nNavalny survived a previous poisoning in 2020 involving a nerve agent attack he blamed on the Kremlin. He later returned to Russia after treatment in Germany and was immediately arrested, spending the final years of his life in prison.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly rejected accusations of using chemical or biological weapons against political opponents.",

We have been defeated here by a small margin of votes. This is the statement of our candidates....we have submitted the list of such constituencies to the commission and asked them to recount the votes there,\" said Jamaat Assistant Secretary General AHM Hamidur Rahman Azad.\n\nHe said this while briefing reporters after a meeting between the delegation and the EC in the city’s Nirbachan Bhaban.\n\nFour election commissioners Abdur Rahmanel Masud, Tahmida Ahmad, Anwarul Islam Sarker and Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah were present in the meeting.\n\nAzad said there are allegations that the agents of their candidates were forcibly removed from many polling stations during the counting of votes and even those who were present in the counting room faced threats and intimidation when they tried to complain about any irregularities.\n\n“The congenial environment required for a fair vote counting has been severely disrupted. So, if there is an error in the vote counting process, it will directly affect the election results—this is natural. At the same time, various types of irregularities -- rubbing, cutting, overwriting and no signatures of our candidate’s original agent in the result sheets in many places,” he said.\n\nResponding to a question, the Jamaat leader said despite the gazette publication of newly elected MPs, legal avenues remain open for them. “There are three legal stages—Election Commission, election tribunal and the High Court. We will follow the legal process,” he said.\n\nAzad also questioned the timing of gazette publication, saying it was issued at 11:00 pm on February 13, just a day after the election. “Candidates from remote areas had no opportunity to submit complaints. We urged the Commission to investigate the allegations. Though legal doors are open, our rights have been undermined,” he said.\n\nThreatening to wage tougher programmes, he said if violence does not stop, the alliance would arrange a protest rally from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram at 3:30 pm on February 16.\n\nThe Jamaat leader expressed concern over post-election violence, citing incidents similar to the Hatiya (Noakhali) violence. “There are questions whether incidents like those in 2018 are recurring. In my own constituency, three women were injured. We have submitted reports from 54 districts,” he said.\n\nHe said the alliance decided to take to the streets if violence does not stop, while playing a constructive opposition role in parliament.\n\nNoting that their alliance MPs would take oath, Azad said the alliance has taken a positive decision regarding oath-taking. “We will take the oath, go to parliament and play a constructive role. At the same time, the streets will remain open for us,” he said.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairman Tarique Rahman addressed a press conference in the capital's Hotel InterContinental on Saturday. Senior BNP leaders were present on the occasion. -AA\n\nBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairman Tarique Rahman said yesterday that BNP will implement all electoral pledges and will make the best of its efforts to drive Bangladesh towards prosperity, harmony, equal rights and socioeconomic justice.\n\nTarique Rahman has said his party is keen on taking initiatives regarding the revival of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\n\n\"Bangladesh was the initiator of SAARC. So naturally, we would want SAARC to be revived. The BNP will take initiatives in this regard after forming the government. The government [then] speaks to neighbouring countries on the issue,\" Tarique Rahman said while speaking at his first post-election press conference at the InterContinental Hotel in the capital on Saturday.\n\nIn response to a question from a journalist about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China-Bangladesh relations, Tarique Rahman said the interests of the people of the country would come first.\n\n\"If the BRI proves helpful and beneficial for Bangladesh's economy, the government would consider the initiative\" Tarique Rahman stated. Asked what the BNP's foreign policy would look like, he said Bangladesh and its people's interests would be given top priority.\n\n\"The country and its citizens would determine the framework of foreign policy\" Tarique Rahman replied.\n\nThe idea for the SAARC emerged from initiatives by Bangladesh in the early 1980s, and then President Ziaur Rahman, the BNP chief's father.\n\nZiaur Rahman is known to have played a key role in proposing regional cooperation among South Asian countries, helping set the stage for SAARC's creation.\n\nSAARC was formally established on 8?December?1985 in Dhaka with its charter signed by the leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri?Lanka and the Maldives.\n\nIt was officially founded by the collective agreement of all the seven South Asian governments in 1985. BNP won a landslide victory in the 13th parliamentary elections which were held on 12 February 2026. BNP declared in its election manifesto ahead of the elections in light of 31 points which formulate BNP's political approach.",

    "title": "1/11 Redux? Not On Our Watch",
    "body": "Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia was holding the hand of her ailing son Tarique Rahman at a hospital after her release from prison in Dhaka on 11 September 2008. -File Photo\n\nThe 13th parliamentary elections have been finally carried out following a lot of speculations. The results of the elections show that Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has won absolute majority in these polls. BNP is expected to form a government very soon. It is widely known to all politically updated individuals how much trials and tribulations BNP had to go through from 2009 to 2024. Even BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia was imprisoned during the ousted Awami League regime but still she did not bow to any regimentation or blood eyes. Begum Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman is currently BNP Chairman who came back to Bangladesh a few months ago. It was observed with alarm how much conspiracies were hatched to restrain Tarique Rahman from returning to Bangladesh. Tarique Rahman was in exile in the United Kingdom for around 17 years. BNP perhaps would not have been able to achieve this landslide victory if ploys succeeded to keep Tarique Rahman away from Bangladesh. Even the party anthem of BNP which was composed and popularized during the presidency of BNP founder Ziaur Rahman was parodied by fanatical groups ahead of these elections. Such disgraceful political malpractices are clear threat to peace and harmony.\n\nThe intrigues that were exercised to disintegrate BNP in absence of Tarique Rahman call back to our remembrances the malevolent situation that prevailed during the tenure of the caretaker government that ruled Bangladesh from 2007 to 2008. This government is most widely known as the 1/11 government because it was constituted on 11 January 2007. A great deal of political ups and downs happened during the 1/11 government's ruling period. One of the gambits of that government was the \"Minus 2\" formula which viciously aimed at terminating Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh politics. Sheikh Hasina and her government were unseated from power on 5 August 2024 and an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus took oath on 8 August in the same year. The ghosts of the 1/11 ordeal came back and plotters became proactive to plunge Bangladesh into the Medieval Era by means of instigating theocracy which also included the sinister target to dismantle Begum Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman from Bangladesh's political landscape. But the conspiracies failed and voters across Bangladesh have chosen liberal democrats and the religious bigots were discarded.\n\nLast 18 months were marked with total devastation in law and order situation throughout Bangladesh, economic catastrophes, dreadful decline in investments, burgeoning unemployment and political vengeance which led to the deaths of more than 3 thousand people and countless numbers of vague police cases against politicians, business leaders, journalists and ordinary people. More than 400 factories were laid off. The unprecedented escalation in mob violence unleashed an ambience of panic everywhere in Bangladesh including big cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, Khulna etcetera. Sensible citizens could figure out precisely that radical assemblages were at the back of the mob atrocities. For this reason voters have declined extremism in these elections and have casted their ballots for a broad-hearted political party that allows generous visions to mount. All Awami League activists and minorities thoroughly and extensively voted for BNP this time.\n\nNow big assignments are waiting for BNP to implement. First and foremost is to stop making monetary gains using political ideologies. It was shocking to see some July Uprising leaders getting involved in extortion, bribery and retaliation which hit news headlines at home and abroad a number of times. Partisanship and politicization of bureaucracy, financial systems, political influence on law enforcement agencies etcetera must be wiped out with an iron hand by the new government. The 1/11 orchestrators are prowling around in pursuit of opportunities to sneak into ruling authorities and to spoil the prospects of rule of law and accountability that have been missing in Bangladesh for years after years. Even the interim government failed to exercise good governance as a result of which state machineries and legal frameworks were abused by evil entities to endanger media professionals, civil society platforms, business enterprises, academia and so on. Demolition of the houses and assets belonging to political opponents in the wake of 5 August 2024 terrorized all peace-loving people in Bangladesh and also maligned the country's image in the international arena.\n\nArson attacks were launched on newspaper offices, minorities and cultural institutions. Women and girls were subjected to gang rapes and other forms of physical assaults over and over again. Veteran journalists and academic scholars were arrested for speaking out the truth. BNP leaders must take firm steps to put an end to these ugly visages of misgovernance without delay.\n\nBegum Khaleda Zia was Bangladesh Prime Minister for three terms. She was also the first woman Prime Minister among the Muslim majority countries. Painfully true that she was deprived of meeting her elder son Tarique Rahman during last 16 years. Even she was not allowed to see her younger son Arafat Rahman Koko when he died in 2015. Such vindictive and ruthless political circumference should never be allowed to return to Bangladesh.\n\nVoters in Bangladesh have exposed their full-fledged denial of the quarters who oppose the spirit of the Liberation War of 1971. An attempt to drive Bangladesh into the insurmountable potholes of Sub Saharan countries has been baffled by the people of Bangladesh through the elections held on 12 February 2026.\n\nBangladeshis are a courageous nation. They did not bow their heads during 1971. Neither did they retreat during 2024. A new sunrise has illuminated the horizon. Let us move forward and embrace the new pathway that just unfolded in front of us.\n\nSimanto Chowdhury is an author and geopolitical analyst.",

    "body": "The American aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, on its way into the Oslofjord, at Drobak in Norway on Sep 12, 2025. -AP\n\nThe U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two U.S. officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.\n\nThe disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.\n\nU.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action, Reuters reports.\n\nU.S. officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.\n\nTrump, speaking to U.S. troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had \"been difficult to make a deal\" with Iran. \"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained U.S. military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.\"\n\n\"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nThe United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHowever, June's \"Midnight Hammer\" operation was essentially a one-off U.S. attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a U.S. base in Qatar.\n\nThe planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.\n\nIn a sustained campaign, the U.S. military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.\n\nExperts say the risks to U.S. forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.\n\nThe same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would \"be very traumatic, very traumatic.\"\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any U.S. military base.\n\nThe U.S. maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, \"it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.\"\n\nIran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.",

    "body": "People protest outside the High Court as judges prepare to rule on a legal challenge to the British government's decision to designate pro?Palestinian group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation, in London, Britain, February 13, 2026. -Reuters\n\nBritain's ban on pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation was ruled unlawful by London's High Court on Friday, though the ban will temporarily remain in place and the government said it would appeal against the decision.\n\nPalestine Action was proscribed in July, having increasingly taken \"direct action\" against Israel-linked defence companies in Britain, often blocking entrances or spraying red paint, Reuters reports.\n\nBritain argued the group's escalating actions amounted to terrorism, citing a 2024 raid on a factory of Israel's largest defence firm Elbit Systems, in which prosecutors said activists caused around 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) of damage and a police officer was hit with a sledgehammer.\n\nPalestine Action was banned shortly after a June break-in at the Royal Air Force's Brize Norton air base, in which activists damaged two planes, an action described by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as \"disgraceful\". Lawyers representing Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020, argued at a hearing last year that the move was an authoritarian restriction on the right to protest.\n\nJudge Victoria Sharp said Palestine Action \"promotes its political cause through criminality and the encouragement of criminality\".\n\nThe High Court nonetheless ruled the ban was a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression, though the ban was not lifted ahead of a further hearing to decide whether it should remain pending an appeal.\n\nInterior minister Shabana Mahmood said in a statement: \"I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.\"\n\nThe ban put Palestine Action on a par with Islamic State or al Qaeda and made it a criminal offence to be a member, carrying a maximum 14-year prison sentence.\n\nMore than 2,000 people have since been arrested for holding signs in support of the group - though Friday's ruling could lead to any criminal charges being dropped.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said following the judgment that it would focus on gathering evidence where people expressed support for Palestine Action rather than making arrests. Civil liberties groups including Amnesty International had called for the ban to be lifted and Irish novelist Sally Rooney said it could even lead to her books being withdrawn from sale due to her public support for Palestine Action.\n\nThe British government argued proscription only prevented support for Palestine Action and had not prevented people from protesting in favour of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe High Court, however, said it could cause pro-Palestinian protesters to \"exercise self-restraint in terms of what they say and what they do\".\n\nThe judgment was announced two weeks after six people charged over the 2024 raid on Elbit were all acquitted of aggravated burglary.\n\nProsecutors have said they will seek a retrial on those counts on which the jury could not reach a verdict, including the alleged assault on a police officer.",

Syria agreed to join the anti-IS coalition when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House in November.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal from Al-Tanf and the government's advances in northeast Syria, US troops are now primarily based at the Qasrak base in Hasakeh, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nDespite IS's territorial defeat, the group remains active.\n\nIt was blamed for a December attack in Palmyra in which a lone gunman opened fire on American personnel, killing two US soldiers and a US civilian.\n\nWashington has conducted retaliatory strikes on IS targets in Syria, and CENTCOM says it has killed or captured more than 50 IS militants in the past two months.",

In an interview with Indian news channel WION, Humayun Kabir, foreign policy advisor to BNP chief Tarique, said the invitation would be extended as a gesture of goodwill as the party prepares to form the next government.\n\nNoting that regional diplomacy would be a priority under a Tarique-led administration, he said: \"The region is important to us.

He has also held postings in Spain and Colombia, and served as joint secretary in India's Ministry of External Affairs handling ties with Western Europe and the European Union.\n\nAs per Hindustan Times, New Delhi had decided last year to appoint a Bengali-speaking diplomat as high commissioner to Bangladesh amid efforts to rebuild relations that deteriorated during the tenure of the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.",

    "body": "Iran and the United States have yet to set a date for a new round of talks after an initial encounter last week on the contested Iranian nuclear programme but, for now, US President Donald Trump is not rushing to launch military action against the Islamic republic.\n\nAFP looks at a critical juncture in the modern history of Iran in the wake of the crackdown on the biggest protests in years in January that according to rights groups has left thousands dead.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on February 6 held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediator, although Tehran did later confirm that there was a handshake.\n\nIran's supreme national security council head Ali Larijani, a mainstay of the establishment for the last decades, this week followed this up with visits to Oman and then US ally Qatar. There was speculation about the contents of a piece of paper he brandished during the visit to Oman, but so far no new date for talks has been set.\n\n\"We didn't have a letter for the Americans, but our Omani friends had some communications,\" Larijani told Iranian state television. \"There were some remarks the Omani side told us on behalf of the Americans,\" he added, without offering further clues.\n\nTrump had hailed the Oman talks as \"very good\" and said there would be another meeting \"early\" this week, something that has not materialised. In an upbeat interview with the Financial Times, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan indicated that compromise was possible on the key sticking point of uranium enrichment.\n\nThe West believes Iran is seeking a nuclear bomb, a charge Tehran denies, and wants a halt to uranium enrichment, a key step in weaponising an atomic programme.\n\n\"It is positive that the Americans appear willing to tolerate Iranian enrichment within clearly set boundaries,\" said Fidan, who has held talks with Iranian and American counterparts.\n\nIn a statement after meeting Trump on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the American president thinks he is creating conditions that could achieve \"a good deal\". But Netanyahu expressed \"general scepticism\" and demanded that any deal also consider Iran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies and not just the nuclear programme.\n\nHowever, Iran's number one, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who for years has pushed a line of confrontation with Washington.\n\n, has yet to give any public blessing to the diplomacy.\n\n\"The enemies who sought to subjugate the Iranian nation through their statements and plans have been thwarted,\" he said in a message broadcast by state television hailing the turnout Wednesday at rallies commemorating the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nTrump has never ruled out military action on Iran after its crackdown on protests, although he is now focusing on a deal over the nuclear drive.\n\nMore than 7,000 people were killed, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency NGO, the vast majority of them -- 6,506 -- protesters.\n\nAn American naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and dubbed an \"armada\" by Trump remains in Middle Eastern waters in a clear warning to Iran.\n\nBut the talks in Washington on Wednesday between Trump and Netanyahu, who has long urged a tougher US line on Iran, ended with Trump saying he had insisted \"negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated\".\n\nTrump added on Thursday: \"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Washington was readying the deployment of a second aircraft carrier strike group to the region, even if no final decision had been taken and plans could change.\n\nThe deployment could take place within a timescale of two weeks and the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush could be ready to \"expedite\" exercises it was currently involved in, it said.\n\nIsrael in June waged a 12-day war with Iran backed by the US that was widely seen as degrading -- but not destroying -- Iranian nuclear and ballistic capabilities.\n\nRoss Harrison, senior fellow with the US-based Middle East Institute and author of \"Decoding Iran's Foreign Policy\", argued that the talks represented more of a US \"ultimatum\" towards Iran rather than \"true negotiations\".\n\nBy participating, Iran was trying to \"buy some time, so they can rebuild their missile programme and so forth -- not necessarily the nuclear programme -- but the missile programme\", he said, adding that the target audience of Tehran's diplomatic efforts was not necessarily Washington.\n\n\"Israel is pushing Trump towards more aggression, but Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) are trying to push Trump towards an authentic diplomatic track,\" he said.\n\n\"What the Iranians are doing is showing some good faith by attending these talks, but the real target is not the United States. I think it's our Gulf Arab allies that can possibly forestall a military attack,\" he added.",

I Did It Again\" and \"Toxic\" singer had signed the deal on December 30.It quoted sources as saying it was \"in the ballpark\" of Canadian singer Justin Bieber's reported $200 million agreement to sell his music rights to Hipgnosis in 2023.\n\nA person familiar with the situation said news of the Spears and Primary Wave deal was accurate. No further details were given. Primary Wave, which is home to artists including Whitney Houston, Prince and Stevie Nicks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spears has not commented publicly.\n\nThe 44-year-old, one of the most successful pop artists of all time, has topped charts around the world, starting off with \"...Baby One More Time\" in 1998. The deal includes her songs such as \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", \"Circus\", \"Gimme More\" and \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", TMZ said. Spears' ninth and last studio album, \"Glory\", came out in 2016. In 2021, she was released from a 13-year court-ordered conservatorship set up and controlled by her father, Jamie Spears. The arrangement had governed Spears' personal life, career and $60 million estate from 2008 until it was terminated in November 2021. Spears follows artists such as Sting, Bruce Springsteen and Justin Timberlake who have struck deals to cash in on their work.",

    "body": "The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has described America as \"a child of Europe\" and made an emotional but highly conditional offer of a new partnership, insisting the two continents belong together.\n\nIn a much-anticipated speech at the annual Munich Security Conference, he said the US was intent on building a new world order, adding \"while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe\". The US and Europe, he said \"belong together\", the Guardian reports.\n\nAdmitting the Americans may come across as a little direct and urgent, he said this was only because the US was profoundly concerned by the fate of Europe, and knew their destinies were intertwined.\n\nOverall the tone of the speech was greeted with relief by the delegates in the hall, although many pointed out Rubio was not offering a partnership of equals, but an alliance largely framed in Donald Trump's terms.\n\nIn offering the hand of friendship, in sharp contrast to the tone adopted by the US vice president, JD Vance, at the same conference last year, Rubio made clear the US was not shifting on its fundamental approach.\n\nHe said the US under Trump did not want a Europe that was weak or shackled by guilt or shame.\n\nHe continued: \"We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the west's managed decline. We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history. What we want is a reinvigorated alliance that recognises that what has ailed our societies is not just a set of bad policies, but a malaise of hopelessness and complacency.\"\n\nHe also tried to bind Europe into Trump's ideology by saying Europe and the US had made the same mistakes together, including bowing down to \"a climate cult\", expanding welfare states at the expense of national defence, embracing globalisation and \"a world without borders in which everyone would be a citizen of the world\".\n\nGaining control of national borders was not an expression of xenophobia or hate, he said. \"It is a fundamental act of national sovereignty. And the failure to do so is not just an abdication of one of our most basic duties owed to our people, it is an urgent threat to the fabric of our societies and the survival of our civilisation itself.\" He said in rebuilding the global order it would not be necessary to dismantle institutions such as the UN but to reform and rebuild them, arguing it had been Trump, not the UN, that was solving crises in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\n\"In a perfect world, all of these problems and more would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world. And we cannot continue to allow those who blatantly and openly threaten our citizens and endanger our global stability to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate.\n\n\"This is the path that President Trump and the United States has embarked upon. It is the path we ask you here in Europe to join us on.\"\n\nRubio blamed \"a foolish but voluntary transformation\" of western economies that \"left us dependent on others for our needs and dangerously vulnerable to crisis. Mass migration is not, was not, some fringe concern of little consequence. It was and continues to be a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the west.\"\n\nThroughout the speech he showered praise on Europe's history, but in so doing raised questions whether Europe had the capacity to join the US's rebuilding of the world.\n\nHe said little in his speech about Ukraine, after he skipped a meeting with European leaders on Friday night pointing to scheduling issues. But he said he believed the two sides had narrowed the items of difference, while the remaining issues were the hardest ones.",

    "body": "Facing the possibility of losing power after 16 years, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has cast Hungary's election on April 12 as a stark choice between \"war or peace\", saying his opponents would drag the country into the war raging next door in Ukraine. \"We will decide our fate in April. What's at stake is: war or peace,\" Orban, leader of the nationalist Fidesz party, said on Facebook this week. \"For peace, Fidesz is the safe choice.\"\n\nHungarian voters have been bombarded with letters from Orban urging them to fill out a \"national petition\" rejecting European Union financial aid to Ukraine, a message constantly reinforced on state television, which is firmly under government control, Reuters reports. Fidesz has also put up billboards nationwide that depict an obedient-looking opposition leader Peter Magyar saying \"yes\" as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen demands \"Money for Ukraine!\" and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asks for weapons.\n\nOrban has long been at loggerheads with the EU over Ukraine, among many other issues. Defying Brussels, he has maintained cordial ties with Moscow, refuses to send weapons to Ukraine, and says Kyiv can never join the EU.\n\nMagyar's centre-right Tisza party, which leads most opinion polls, says it wants Hungary to rejoin the European mainstream after years of strained relations under Orban that has seen crucial EU funds blocked.\n\nMagyar has dismissed Orban's campaign as laughable \"propaganda\", but Tisza has trodden cautiously on Ukraine, saying it opposes any fast-track EU accession for Kyiv and that it would put the issue to a binding referendum if it wins power.\n\nUkraine needs the backing of all 27 EU nations to join.\n\nPolitical analysts link Orban's focus on the war to the state of Hungary's economy, which remains mired in stagnation after an inflationary surge triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Inflation has since subsided.\n\n\"Lacking a strong performance of the economy, Orban tries to present himself as the guarantor of stability and security, saying that if he goes, there will be chaos,\" said Robert Laszlo from the Budapest think-tank Political Capital.\n\n\"This has worked when it comes to strengthening Fidesz' voter base, but it is not yet clear whether he will manage to address undecided voters or lure back voters who drifted to Tisza,\" Laszlo added.\n\nIn the town of Gyongyos, a Fidesz stronghold some 230 km (143 miles) from the Ukraine border, some people said the war was a key concern for them.\n\n\"We should not swap stability for the uncertain choice, and especially, no one wants the war,\" said Szabolcs Dauka, 39.

He lambasted the six as \"traitors\" guilty of \"sedition at the highest levels\" who should potentially be eligible for the death penalty. His bid for revenge was backed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has launched an effort to lower Kelly's last rank of captain and clip his retirement pay.\n\nBut it emerged on Tuesday that federal prosecutors in Washington had failed to convince a grand jury to indict the lawmakers.

The photo shows the couple’s hands gently holding their son’s tiny hand, offering a tender and intimate moment. Along with the image, they wrote, “Our ray of light, Vihaan Kaushal. Prayers are answered. Life is beautiful. Our world is changed in an instant. Gratitude beyond words.”\n\nCelebrities and fans flooded the comment section with love. Parineeti Chopra wrote, “Little buddy.\" Bhumi Pednekar and Dia Mirza reacted with heart emojis. Fans were equally delighted to see the baby and learn his name finally. One comment read, “May God’s grace always shine on you, little Vihaan.” Another pointed out, “Vicky’s character in Uri was named Vihaan.” Others wrote, “Beautiful name! May he always be a source of light and happiness,” and “Such a tiny hand—so adorable. May God bless him with all the joy in the world.” Vicky and Katrina first met at an award show, where comedian Sunil Grover introduced them backstage. During the event, Vicky jokingly proposed to Katrina on stage. The two later began dating and kept their relationship largely private until they tied the knot on December 9, 2021, in an intimate yet grand wedding at Six Senses Fort Barwara in Rajasthan.",

They were there to make sure we’re not being recorded without consent,\" she said.\n\n\"That’s my biggest thing with everyone having cellphones. It happens often, especially with my daughter. We’re in the park or having ice cream, and suddenly I’ll see it online. My security is for that reason. Otherwise, I don’t need it.

    "body": "Italy's Anthony Mosca celebrates after winning in the end of the 2026 ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match against Nepal at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday. -AFP\n\nItaly created history on Thursday, as they defeated Nepal by 10 wickets to register their first win in a men's World Cup match.\n\nComing into this match, both the teams had a point to prove. Tournament debutants Italy are eager to show that they are not here to make up the numbers, while Nepal suffered a heartbreaking loss to England in their opening match.\n\nIn this battle of associate nations, it was Italy who came out with the right intent at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.\n\nAfter electing to field, they put in a clinical performance with the ball and in the field to dismiss Nepal for 123. They never let up in the chase as well, cantering to the target in 12.4 overs. It was the kind of calm, dominant show befitting an experienced team rather than World Cup rookies. From pole to podium, the Italians were in charge.\n\nThe Nepal innings never really got going after losing Kushal Bhurtel. Captain Rohit Paudel tried to inject some urgency with a 23 off 14 balls and Aarif Sheikh top-scored with 27 lower down the order.\n\nHowever, Italy's spin-heavy attack and impressive fielding kept Nepal at bay. Not only did they clamp down the scoring, they also took timely wickets. Karan KC gave the innings a late fillip with a quickfire 18, but Nepal folded at 123 in 19.3 overs.\n\nLeg-spinner Crishan Kalugamage finished with three wickets, including that of captain Pauel and the experienced Dipendra Singh Airee, while off-spinner Benjamin Manenti was exceptional, claiming 2/9 in his four overs.\n\nThe Italians made a meal of the modest total. Anthony Mosca and brother Justin Mosca were unstoppable, as they matches each other stroke for stroke, power for power. Justin struck five fours and three sixes for 60 not out, while Anthony, three years older, slammed six sixes and three fours for an unbeaten 62 off 32 balls.\n\n>ICC",

    "body": "“One Battle After Another” dominated nominations to the Actor Awards on Wednesday, with Paul Thomas Anderson’s ragtag revolutionary saga landing a record seven nods in the annual SAG-AFTRA honors.\n\nIn the 31 years of the Actor Awards, formerly known as the Screen Actors Guild Awards, no movie has received more than five nominations. Along with a nod for the guild’s top award, best ensemble, the cast of “One Battle After Another” was showered with nominations for Leonardo DiCaprio, Chase Infiniti, Teyana Taylor, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and its stunt performers.\n\nThe four other nominees for best ensemble are: “Sinners,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme” and “Frankenstein.” Usually, to win best picture at the Oscars, a movie needs a SAG ensemble nomination. Only four films in the last three decades have managed the feat without that. Among the films that missed the cut this year were “Sentimental Value,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Train Dreams.”\n\n“Sinners” had an especially good result. Along with a best male actor nod for Michael B. Jordan, supporting actors Miles Caton and Wunmi Mosaku were both nominated. It collected five nominations in total.\n\nIn television, Apple’s “The Studio,” HBO’s “White Lotus” and Netflix’s “Adolescence” lead the nominees.\n\nHistorically, the Actor Awards have been one of the strongest Oscar indicators. Actors make up the largest branch of the film academy, and, in the past, individual SAG nominees have overlapped with the Oscar field at a rate of roughly four out of five. The Actor Awards are presented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nThat means the nominees Wednesday may closely resemble those headed to the Oscars. They are:\n\nBest male actor: DiCaprio, Timothée Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), Michael B. Jordan (“Sinners”), Ethan Hawke (“Blue Moon”) and Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”). The only surprise of that group was Plemons. The favorite remains the 30-year-old Chalamet who won the same award last year for “A Complete Unknown” and vowed to pursue “greatness” in his acceptance speech.\n\nBest female actor: Infiniti, Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”).",

    "body": "Last year, actor Faissal Khan alleged that his family once kept him under house arrest, and accused his brother and actor Aamir Khan of misusing his power and influence to bring him down. Now, Aamir has addressed the conflict, saying he refused to fight with his own family.\n\nIn an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Aamir spoke about his ongoing feud with his brother Faissal Khan, with whom he starred in film Mela along with Twinkle Khanna. Mela was released on January 7, 2000.\n\nWhen asked about Faissal accusing Aamir of multiple transgressions, including illegal confinement and career sabotage, the actor said, “Kya karein? (What to do?) That is my destiny. You can fight the world, but how can you fight your own family?”\n\nTalking about the failure of Mela, Aamir added, “I was obviously disappointed by its failure to achieve its potential. Beyond that, I think it’s tough to answer your question. First of all, let me tell you, every film I do means a lot to me. The failure of Mela definitely made a difference to me. It was hard on Faissal, but it was hard on me as well. I’m not comfortable with the idea of any of my films not realising their full potential. The entire team had worked very hard. We were all disappointed.”\n\nLast year, tensions between Aamir and Faissal came into the spotlight with Faissal declaring that he has severed all ties with the family. He has alleged that Aamir had an affair with UK-based Jessica Hines while still married to his first wife, Reena Dutta, and even fathered a child with the journalist.\n\nIn an interview with Hindustan Times, Faissal accused Aamir of carefully crafting a public persona that, according to him, is far removed from reality. “He is trying to create a clean image for the audience, but you can find out his image by him having so many relationships with women and all that… He likes to whitewash his image which is not the reality,” he said.",

    "title": "G20 Benchmark: India’s Journey From Clean Energy Pledges to Real Impact",
    "body": "Collected Image\n\nPralhad Joshi, president of the ISA Assembly & Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, India 2025 was a defining year for India's clean energy transition with India now being the sole G20 country to achieve its 2030 target, under Nationally Determined Contributions, five years ahead of the defined timeline. Non-fossil fuels now account for 50% of the total installed power capacity of 484 GW. India’s clean energy progress witnessed the addition of 44.5 GW of renewable energy capacity. This represents the largest annual increase on record, almost doubling the previous year's figures. Solar power capacity climbed to 135 GW, and wind capacity neared 54 GW. These milestones become even more critical in today’s world, where extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, are being observed across countries, amid concerns about missing global targets agreed upon at the Paris COP. Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, called this achievement a reflection of “India’s deepening commitment towards a green and sustainable future.”\n\nIndia’s success in renewable energy reflects a strong political will to create an ecosystem of policy and regulatory support, integrated planning of the power system, transmission strengthening to absorb variable renewable energy, institutional mechanisms like Solar Energy Corporation of India for derisking, strengthening private sector capacity and enabling capital markets for local currency financing. Auctions and reverse-auction mechanisms, along with technological advancements, have led to a reduction of almost 80% in solar project tariffs over the last decade. At the same time, schemes such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) stimulated domestic solar module production, increasing solar module manufacturing capacity to 144 GW, with 81 GW added alone in 2025.\n\nThe impact of India’s achievements has helped the country save INR 4 lakh crore in pollution-related costs (more than $46 billion), which can be invested in other developmental areas. This includes $14.9 billion in fossil fuel savings, 410.9 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions avoided, and $31.7 billion in health and air pollution benefits. As this velocity progresses towards the 500 GW target by 2030, focus is on expanding renewables and emerging technologies through dedicated interventions. The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana is expanding rooftop solar access for households, with 18 lakh+ houses already powered; the PM Kusum is empowering farmers to solarise their energy needs, with plans to solarise 4 million pumps; and the National Green Hydrogen Mission is facilitating the development of a green hydrogen ecosystem with India’s production prices being among the lowest globally. These initiatives reveal a critical insight: energy transformation is not just about building infrastructure—it’s about an integrated ecosystem approach across the solar value chain to create inclusive growth and jobs.\n\nMany countries in the Global South continue to face challenges like those India grappled with a decade ago. India's efforts to expand energy access were hindered by several factors which included limited public funds, lack of strong policy goals, and weaknesses in private and local financial institutions that are crucial for investment. India’s experience offers not only a blueprint for affordable, reliable, and resilient renewable energy but also the potential for digital leapfrogging in the Global South, ensuring that developing countries are not left behind in adopting the rapidly evolving digital and AI transformation of the energy sector, which would lead to the optimal utilisation of renewables. However, the deciding factor will be how these countries can turn the blueprint into action.\n\nAs President of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) Assembly, India is playing a central role in translating its domestic clean energy experience into global action. Headquartered in India, the ISA reflects to amplifying the voice of the Global South and 125 member countries in shaping the global energy transition. ISA’s vision, staunchly embedded in the premise ‘From Ambition to Action’, as was also echoed by the COP30 Presidency as the need of the hour, is built around four strategic pillars—mobilising catalytic finance for facilitating private sector investment, building capability and institutions especially through digitisation, aggregating demand for countries and connecting the world through One Sun One World One Grid—aligns closely with India’s journey. India’s experience exhibits what effective scale looks like - from rooftop rollouts to solar parks, to rural mini grids supported by an ecosystem built on innovative financing models and robust institutional frameworks. ISA is actively facilitating this transfer of knowledge and experience — particularly in Africa and Small Island Developing States (SIDS)—across areas such as energy access, capacity building, energy transition planning, digital infrastructure, and new distributed renewable energy models.\n\nIndia's clean energy leadership was recently spotlighted at the COP, sixth IRENA Assembly, and the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week where it influenced global conversations and further paved way for international collaboration. India's achievements offer both inspiration and a roadmap for the world, demonstrating a model that can be tailored to different local contexts, available resources, and specific goals.\n\n>> Source: Newsweek",

    "title": "EU chiefs as Republic Day guests underscore deepening partnership and India’s rising global standing",
    "body": "European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa and the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, paying a State Visit to India as Chief Guest at the 77th Republic Day celebrations, carry deep diplomatic, strategic, and economic significance. It conveys the historic recognition of India’s global standing, the strong push to finalising Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s positioning as a strategic bridge in the multipolar world and the enhancement of security and defence partnership.\n\nThe European Council (EC) said the visit strengthens the bilateral relationship between India and Europe. “India is a crucial partner for the EU. Together, we share the capacity and responsibility to protect the rules-based international order. This meeting will be a key opportunity to build on our partnership and drive progress in our cooperation,” Costa said.Ursula von der Leyen has called India “a pillar of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world”, stressing inter-regional cooperation, security and defence cooperation.\n\nA few months ago, the council endorsed the ‘New Strategic EU-India Agenda’ which stressed prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, security and defence, and connectivity and global issues, besides FTA. Underlining India’s role in the increasingly complex geopolitical outlook, it acknowledged the establishment of a security and defence partnership. “The Council also welcomes closer collaboration between the EU and India on security and defence matters,” it said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron underscored India’s importance in meeting the global security challenges and maintaining peace and stability.Even British Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended support to India for a permanent place on the UN Security Council, even as he praised the trade deal with India, calling it “the biggest and most economically significant” since the UK left the EU.\n\nObservers stated that the EU saw New Delhi as an important and strategic player in global trade streamlining, in which New Delhi—and not just as a bilateral partner, but as a systemic actor in shaping the future of global trade governance. Carnegie Europe Director Rosa Balfour called the EU and India like-minded partners who can help ensure stability in international trade. “There’s a lot of promise to increase the exchange of goods, the mobility of people, the exchange of capital, investments, and technological cooperation. It seems to present the seeds of an alternative strategy to a global trade war,” she said.\n\nMany European leaders and officials endorsed a deeper partnership with India in recent times as they viewed India as a reliable growth engine and a contributor to regional and maritime security. The latest visit by the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is seen as central to the European shift toward India. “Highly dynamic India and technologically advanced Germany share essential interests,” said the leader of the EU’s strongest member.\n\nThe growing need for cooperation in technology and security is widely spoken of by the European leaders. Spanish President Pedro Sánchez sought to boost ties and cooperation, especially in defence.After inaugurating an Airbus assembly facility in the Indian state of Gujarat, Sánchez said “This plant sums up perfectly the excellent state of bilateral relations between Spain and India.” Speaking about how India and the EU complement each other, Italian Ambassador Antonio Bartoli said “Italy is one of the most interesting and reliable partners, and we can develop a lot together. This will be even more enhanced by the conclusion of the FTA.”\n\nEconomic ties between the EU and India continued to deepen over the years, as the trade in goods increased by 90 percent over the past decade. With trade touching Euro 120 billion, the EU became India’s second-largest trading partner in 2024. Now, FTA is expected to be signed during the upcoming 16th EU-India Summit, thus consolidating these gains and providing a comprehensive framework for deeper economic integration. Ursula von der Leyen said a historic trade agreement was just around the corner. “Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,” she said.\n\nThe FTA is more than an economic partnership as it offers the EU strategic hedging against the geopolitical manoeuvrings by the global superpowers, said former Indian Ambassador to France Mohan Kumar. “EU and India have the potential to occupy independent poles in an emerging multipolar world,” he said. Kumar further said that New Delhi was a serious claimant to the leadership of the Global South, even as the EU and India have had the potential to become independent poles in a growing multipolar world. “The geopolitical alignment between the EU and India is unmistakable,” he said.\n\n>> Source: European Times",

    "title": "Why India's 2026 BRICS presidency matters for multilateralism",
    "body": "\"Demonstrators gather outside the Daniel Patrick Moynihan US Courthouse as ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro awaits his arraignment hearing. US special forces conducted a daring raid in Caracas, capturing Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores on narco-terrorism charges, followed by announcements of prolonged US oversight of Venezuela's vast oil reserves.\"\n\nAS India assumes the BRICS presidency for 2026, the grouping gains renewed relevance at a moment when multilateral diplomacy faces its sternest test. The opening week of 2026 has seen a flurry of bold US foreign policy actions under President Donald Trump.\n\nOn January 3, US special forces conducted a daring raid in Caracas, capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores on narco-terrorism charges, followed by announcements of prolonged US oversight of Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Just days earlier, on Christmas Day 2025, US strikes targeted alleged ISIS camps in northwest Nigeria’s Sokoto State, justified as protecting Nigerian Christians from terrorism.\n\nMeanwhile, renewed threats to acquire Greenland, citing national security, rare earth minerals, and Arctic routes, have escalated tensions with Denmark, a NATO ally, with the White House not ruling out military options. Many nations in the Global South are searching for platforms that defend global norms.\n\nThese developments, unfolding rapidly, raise profound questions for the Global South.\n\nIndian columnist TK Arun provides a compelling framework for understanding the current global shift. In prescient writings such as his December 31, 2025, Substack post “2026: Into the world according to Trump” and a subsequent analysis for The Core titled Trump’s Imperial Turn Leaves India With No Easy Choices, Arun characterises Trump’s foreign policy as a deliberate revival of 19th-century imperialism.\n\nHe draws a direct parallel to figures like President William McKinley, arguing that this approach actively dismantles the post-World War II rules-based order, a system built on treaties, sovereignty, and multilateralism. In its place, Arun contends, Trump is erecting a paradigm of transactional dominance where raw self-interest and resource extraction are paramount.\n\nThis thesis is crystallised in actions like the Venezuela intervention, which, though framed by Trump as a law-enforcement operation, ultimately resulted in US control over the nation’s oil exports, epitomising the new imperial logic.\n\nArun extends this critique to coercive economic tools, such as threats of up to 500% tariffs on nations buying Russian oil, forcing alignment or punishment. The Nigeria strikes, coordinated with local authorities but framed by Trump as a “Christmas present” to terrorists targeting Christians, risk expanding US footprints in Africa under anti-terror pretexts.\n\nGreenland threats, Arun implies in his broader analysis of imperial resurgence, could also fracture alliances like NATO, treating sovereignty as negotiable when it suits US strategic needs.\n\nEvaluating Arun’s insights against January 2026 realities: His warnings of imperial revival are strikingly validated. The Venezuela operation, while tactically successful in capturing Maduro (now facing trial in the US), has drawn bipartisan Senate efforts to curb Trump’s war powers.\n\ncombating narco-terrorism in Venezuela, terrorism in Nigeria, and securing strategic assets in Greenland, seem compelling in regions plagued by corruption, instability, or external threats. In corrupt or failing states, decisive action by the US, promising order and accountability have tempted views of intervention as a “necessary reset”.\n\nArun counters this effectively, elucidating that such moves undermine sovereignty for all nations, setting dangerous precedents and destabilising the system that protects smaller states.\n\nHis core suggestion in his home country is that India should step forward to champion a rules-based global order, independently of waning US leadership. He argues that, as the world’s largest democracy with a tradition of strategic autonomy and non-alignment, India is uniquely positioned to lead this order.\n\nThis involves strengthening institutions like BRICS, building robust bilateral ties with Africa, Latin America, and other Global South regions, and transcending sectarian religious divides and class inequalities. This vision resonates with other Indian commentators, who advocate diversifying partnerships amid unreliable US policies and focusing on self-reliance to weather disruptions.\n\nThe early days of Trump’s second term have confronted the world with a stark conundrum in international diplomacy: how to uphold sovereignty and multilateral norms when a superpower increasingly acts unilaterally, justifying interventions with appeals to security, anti-corruption, and anti-terrorism while pursuing evident resource and strategic gains.\n\nThe Venezuela raid, the Nigeria strikes, and Greenland threats, all framed as necessary for global stability, illustrate this tension. Smaller nations, BRICS+ Nations and the Global South face a dilemma: condemn actions that erode the rules-based order, yet simultaneously grapple with the might of the US. In this age of Trump, diplomacy risks becoming transactional, where “might” overshadows multilateralism.\n\nAfrica, facing its own governance challenges, should prioritise internal reforms, anti-graft measures, and social cohesion to reduce vulnerabilities, inviting pretexts of invasion.\n\nIn this turbulent era, ethical and principled leadership are going to be essential. Arun’s call reminds us that survival demands not submission to might, but collective advocacy for norms that uphold human dignity and sovereignty for all.\n\nWritten by: Phapano Phasha (The author is the chairperson of The Centre for Alternative Political and Economic Thought.)\n\n>>Source: IOL",

    "title": "China’s National Procurators’ Meeting: Prosecutors as Priests of the Gospel According to Xi",
    "body": "The National Procurators’ Meeting. Source: The Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the Republic of China.\n\n”The gathering reminded the officers that “constitutionalism,” “separation of powers,” and “judicial independence” are Western concepts that have no place in China.”\n\nOn January 19, Beijing hosted the annual National Procurators’ Meeting—China’s highest gathering of prosecutors, though “prosecutors” may no longer be the most accurate job description. Judging from the speeches that are now being published in various outlets, they have been reassigned to a different profession: ideological clergy. Their task is not so much to enforce the law as to enforce the correct thought, and the correct thought, as always, comes with a proper name attached.\n\nThe meeting opened with the usual invocation: a solemn call to “thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions on comprehensively governing the country according to law, on political‑legal work, and on procuratorial work.” The 2025 work summary and 2026 task list were presented. Still, the real agenda was simpler: prosecutors must “uphold Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding principle,” “firmly support the ‘Two Establishes’,” and “resolutely achieve the ‘Two Upholds’.” In other words, the rule of law begins with the rule of Xi.\n\nProcurator-General Ying Yong delivered the keynote sermon. He praised the past year’s achievements, attributing them—naturally—to “the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core.” The prosecutors’ successes, he explained, were not due to legal expertise, investigative skill, or judicial independence (perish the thought), but to “the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.” One could almost hear the collective sigh of relief from the legal professionals in the room: no need to worry about jurisprudence when ideology does all the heavy lifting.\n\nYing then clarified the true nature of the procuratorate: “Procuratorial organs are first and foremost political organs; being clear-cut in stressing politics is the primary requirement.” Justice, it seems, is a secondary hobby. The primary requirement is to “firmly safeguard the authority and centralized, unified leadership of the Party Central Committee,” and to “consciously implement the Party’s absolute leadership in all aspects and all links of procuratorial work.”\n\nTo avoid any confusion, Ying listed the forbidden doctrines: Western “constitutionalism,” “separation of powers,” and “judicial independence.” These, he warned, are “erroneous viewpoints.” The prosecutors nodded dutifully, perhaps relieved that they would not be burdened with such dangerous concepts as checks and balances.\n\nInstead, they were instructed to “organically unify the implementation of the Party’s line, principles, and policies with the implementation of national laws.” In practice, this means the law must follow the Party, not the other way around. Xi Jinping’s “Thought on the Rule of Law” thus reveals its true nature: a theory of replacing the rule of law with the rule of loyalty. The legal system becomes a conveyor belt delivering political directives into judicial outcomes.\n\nThe meeting also reaffirmed the sacred duty of defending “political security” above all else. Prosecutors were told to “severely crack down on all types of crimes endangering national security,” a category so elastic it can include anything from espionage to posting the wrong meme. They must also “resolutely safeguard the security of the state power, the system, and ideology”—a trinity of insecurities that keeps the prosecutorial apparatus permanently mobilized.\n\nEconomic crimes, cybercrimes, juvenile crimes, and public‑interest litigation were all mentioned, but always framed within the same ideological scaffolding. Even the protection of minors was presented as part of the Party’s grand political mission. The message was that every legal task is political, and every political task is a legal obligation.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a reminder that prosecutors must “study, think, and practice Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law,” a phrase that roughly translates to “absorb, internalize, and apply the correct ideology.” One imagines a future where law schools offer courses titled “Advanced Xi Jurisprudence” and “Applied Loyalty Studies.”\n\nIn the end, the National Procurators’ Meeting was one of the usual Chinese political liturgies. The participants were not asked to uphold justice, but to uphold the Party. They were not asked to interpret the law, but to interpret Xi Jinping Thought. And they were not asked to defend citizens’ rights, but to protect the state’s ideological security.\n\nIf justice is blind, China’s prosecutors have been instructed to remove the blindfold, check which way the political wind is blowing, and proceed accordingly. The rule of law, in this system, is not a shield protecting the people from power—it is a tool ensuring the people remain obedient to it. (by, Hu Zimo)\n\n>> Source: Bitter Winter",

    "title": "Fields of discontent: Rural China’s rising protests amid deepening economic strains",
    "body": "File Photo\n\nAs China’s economy grapples with prolonged slowdown and structural headwinds, rural unrest across the country has surged, marking a notable escalation in social tensions.\n\nThe rise in protests — driven by economic hardship, land disputes, and community grievances — highlights widening friction between local populations and authorities, particularly in areas where economic opportunities are scarce, and state policies collide with tradition.\n\nData from independent monitors reveal that rural protest incidents in 2025 have climbed sharply, underscoring growing instability in China’s hinterlands.\n\nSteep increase in rural protest incidents\n\nAccording to the China Dissent Monitor (CDM), a project affiliated with Freedom House that tracks civil unrest across mainland China, the first eleven months of 2025 saw approximately 661 rural protest incidents — roughly 70 percent higher than the total for all of 2024.\n\nThese incidents form part of a broader pattern of dissent, with CDM logging 1,392 protest events in the third quarter alone, marking a 45 percent increase year-on-year and the sixth straight quarter of rising protest activity nationwide.\n\nWhile not all protests were rural in origin, rural residents accounted for a significant and growing share of dissent actions, joining labourers, homeowners, and other groups in expressing grievances linked to economic pressures and social policies.\n\nEconomy and rural discontent: A troubled link\n\nThe uptick in rural protests coincides with China’s broader economic slowdown. As industrial output and investment growth have faltered, and employment prospects in urban centres have weakened, many migrant workers have returned to their home villages — only to find limited economic opportunities.\n\nA report in Lianhe Zaobao noted official concern about “preventing the formation of large-scale return and stay of rural migrant workers,” a policy phrase that sparked public anxiety and wider discussion about rural economic stagnation.\n\nUnlike the cities, where diversified employment opportunities and industrial bases can absorb some degree of economic stress, rural regions often depend on agriculture or informal work, exposing residents to deeper vulnerability when macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.\n\nWithout robust rural employment, returning workers frequently find themselves without crops, land or stable incomes — factors that have repeatedly surfaced in protest triggers.\n\nLand and tradition clash with policy enforcement\n\nAmong the most prominent catalysts for rural protests in 2025 were disputes over local government actions perceived as encroachments on traditional practices or property rights. In Lingao County (Hainan) and Fuchuan County (Guangxi), the demolition of a privately built temple and a clan ancestral hall sparked violent confrontations between villagers and officials.\n\nThese sites were viewed by residents as central to their cultural heritage, making the demolitions flashpoints for broader discontent over local governance and land management. Similarly, in Xifeng County, Guizhou, protests erupted over new local mandates requiring the cremation of remains, directly contradicting long-held burial customs.\n\nThe government’s attempt to enforce this policy was interpreted by villagers as an attack on cultural tradition, generating heated resistance that extended beyond administrative compliance to larger protest actions.\n\nThese confrontations reflect a recurring theme across various rural protests: state policies, often framed as modernization measures or administrative directives, are colliding with local norms, property expectations, and historical rights, provoking sustained pushback when community identities are perceived to be under threat.\n\nEconomic pressures amplify longstanding grievances\n\nEconomists and sociologists have highlighted that rural unrest in China often intersects with deeper structural issues such as land expropriation and economic imbalance between urban and rural areas.\n\nWhile specific protests in 2025 have attracted attention, they echo earlier patterns of rural dissent tied to land acquisition disputes, forced relocation, and perceptions of corruption. Past CDM data underscored that land grabs and forced relocation were significant triggers for rural protests even before the broader economic slowdown deepened.\n\nThe return of migrant workers, confronted with dwindling income prospects and, in some cases, lost land rights, further compounds these tensions.\n\nIn many rural settings, agricultural and community land once promised as a safety net for displaced labourers has increasingly been repurposed for industrial or commercial development, leaving returning residents economically stranded and socially disillusioned.\n\nGrowing complexity in protest dynamics\n\nBeyond traditional land and cultural disputes, rural protests in 2025 have reflected broader discontent with governance practices at the local level.\n\nThe diversity of protest drivers — including labour, housing, and educational grievances alongside rural unrest — underscores the widening reach of discontent into multiple sectors of Chinese society.\n\nThe frequency and diversity of these events also illustrate how rural activism, once largely isolated or sporadic, is increasingly part of a broader pattern of public expression against perceived injustices.\n\nWhile rural protests may lack nationwide coordination, their cumulative impact across counties and provinces has contributed to a noticeable rise in overall protest activity recorded throughout this year.\n\nState response and information control\n\nOfficial response to rising protests in rural areas remains constrained by China’s broader approach to dissent and public order. Authorities typically respond with a combination of suppression, targeted policing, and efforts to manage narratives through media control and restrictions on online content.\n\nThis model of state control, known broadly as grid-style social management, relies on extensive surveillance and local reporting networks to monitor and contain dissent before it escalates into larger movements.\n\nDespite such mechanisms, the increase in recorded protest events suggests that local grievances have continued to surface, occasionally breaking through information barriers and drawing attention both domestically and internationally.\n\nIndependent tracking efforts, such as those by the China Dissent Monitor, rely on a mix of public reports, social media indicators, and civil society documentation to piece together a broader picture of unrest often absent from official channels.\n\nWidening social fault lines\n\nThe rise in rural protests in 2025 underlines how economic slowdown — manifesting as limited job growth, stagnating incomes, and rising living costs — is interacting with longstanding structural challenges to fuel social tensions.\n\nIn regions where economic revitalization has lagged and opportunities remain scarce, grassroots discontent continues to find expression through collective action, despite the risks of suppression.\n\nThese developments reveal a deeper fault line in Chinese society — one where economic pressures and shifting demographic patterns intersect with cultural norms and local governance disputes.\n\nAs protests multiply and diversify in rural China, the dynamics of state–society relations appear increasingly strained, with grassroots resistance emerging as a persistent feature of the country’s socio-economic landscape.\n\n>> Source: english.hamrakura",

The project of making fourth generation 'cephalosporin' antibiotic in Bogra is a dream project of EDCL he added.\n\nCurrently there is production of life-saving antibiotic injections of the 'cephalosporin' group. Full scale production of sterile antibiotics or injections has started here.\n\nIn addition, this project has undertaken the production of 12 life-saving sterile antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ceftazidime and cefradin, which are used in the immediate need of serious diseases\n\nAccording to EDCL sources, it has been seven years since the tangle of complications in the acquisition of 6 and half acres of land was unraveled. The land acquisition cost is estimated at 30 crore, which has already been spent subject to subsequent adjustments.\n\nDr Jaglul also said that the money was paid from EDCL's own funds. Now the acquisition of land for the vaccine factory has been completed. I had to work for two long years in this work, said Dr Joglul.\n\nJoglul also said that building a factory for vaccine production is not a trivial matter. There is huge action here. Apart from land, money is also required for setting up a factory. ADB will invest 350 million dollars in the plan that has been taken for this.\n\nHe also said - EDCL has turned into a profitable company during the current government. Officers and workers at all levels of the organization are constantly working to improve the working environment and the quality of medicines. When everything is at a standstill during the COVID period, EDCL has been producing medicines day and night keeping in mind the human service. In order to continue the production, the workers had to be fed in a special way.\n\nIncentives and encouraging environment are created to improve the working environment, physical and mental health of the workers. Joglul believes that the expenditure is not a waste but an investment.\n\n>>Pinky Akter, AA",

    "title": "World Spine Day: Promoting Spinal Health and Well-Being",
    "body": "The World Spine Day theme for 2023 will be EVERY SPINE COUNTS\n\n“Move Your Spine” has been announced as the theme of World Spine Day 2023\n\nEvery year on October 16th, individuals and organizations around the world come together to observe World Spine Day, an annual event dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of spinal health and promoting ways to maintain a strong, flexible, and pain-free spine. The spine is a crucial part of our musculoskeletal system, and its health can significantly impact our overall well-being. World Spine Day aims to educate, inspire, and empower people to take better care of their spines.\n\nThe Significance of Spinal Health\n\nThe spine, also known as the backbone, plays a vital role in our daily lives. It provides structural support for our bodies and protects the delicate spinal cord, which is essential for transmitting messages between the brain and the rest of the body. Maintaining spinal health is essential for various reasons:\n\n1. Mobility and Flexibility: A healthy spine enables us to move, bend, and perform daily activities with ease. It's the cornerstone of our physical well-being.\n\n2. Posture: Proper spinal alignment is crucial for good posture, which not only affects our physical appearance but also our confidence and overall health.\n\n3. Pain Prevention: A well-maintained spine is less likely to cause discomfort and chronic pain conditions, such as backaches and neck pain.\n\n4. Nervous System Function: The spine is responsible for protecting the spinal cord, which is a part of the central nervous system. Any issues with the spine can affect the functioning of our nerves.\n\n5. Quality of Life: Spinal problems can significantly diminish one's quality of life. A healthy spine contributes to a better, more active life.\n\nWorld Spine Day's Goals\n\nWorld Spine Day has several important goals, including:\n\n1. Education: Informing people about the importance of spinal health, including maintaining proper posture, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding behaviors that can harm the spine.\n\n2. Prevention: promoting awareness of common spinal disorders and how to prevent them. Simple lifestyle changes can go a long way toward maintaining spinal health.\n\n3. Advocacy: encouraging individuals to seek professional help when experiencing spinal issues. Early intervention can prevent minor problems from becoming more severe.\n\n4. Community Engagement: inspiring healthcare professionals, organizations, and communities to work together to promote spinal health. This can involve organizing events, workshops, and educational campaigns.\n\nThemes and Activities\n\nEach year, World Spine Day has a specific theme that guides its activities. Themes may revolve around a particular aspect of spinal health or a related issue. Organizers and participants across the globe engage in a variety of events, including:\n\n• Educational campaigns in schools and workplaces.\n\n• Workshops on spine health and proper ergonomics\n\n• Fitness and wellness classes that emphasize exercises to strengthen the spine\n\n• Free or discounted spinal health check-ups\n\n• Community events to raise awareness about spinal health and disorders\n\nConclusion\n\nWorld Spine Day serves as an important reminder of the significance of spinal health and the steps we can take to protect our spines and enjoy a pain-free, active life. By focusing on education, prevention, and advocacy, this annual event contributes to the overall well-being of individuals and communities worldwide. It encourages people to prioritize their spinal health and take proactive steps to maintain a healthy and resilient spine. So, on this World Spine Day and throughout the year, let's all make an effort to stand tall, sit straight, and move freely in support of our spines and our well-being.\n\nProfessor Altaf Hossain Sarker\n\nMusculoskeletal Disorders Specialist\n\n44/8 West Pantopath",

    "body": "Nearly 100 pilot whales have died after beaching in Western Australia, wildlife officials said Thursday, following desperate rescue attempts.\n\nThe pod of 97 long-finned pilot whales gathered in shallow water off Cheynes Beach, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) southeast of Perth, on Tuesday, with scores stranding themselves on the sand.\n\nBy the next morning, 51 of the cetaceans had died.\n\nSome 250 volunteers joined 100 wildlife experts in a vain struggle to save the rest of the pod throughout the day Wednesday.\n\nDozens of people in wetsuits stayed in the water, a few on kayaks or surfboards, trying to coax the tightly packed group of remaining pilot whales into deeper waters, and then out to sea.\n\n\"Volunteers and everyone attempted to get them back out into the deeper water, and then they re-beached themselves,\" a spokeswoman for the Parks and Wildlife Service told AFP.\n\n\"From that point, the vets assessed them and it was determined on welfare grounds that they needed to be euthanised.\"\n\nIncident controller Peter Hartley thanked rescuers for their \"enormous efforts\" to save the whales in cold waters.\n\n\"Probably one of the hardest decisions in my 34 years in wildlife management -- really, really difficult,\" he told journalists Thursday.\n\nBut the decision to euthanise the pilot whales was \"considered\", Hartley said.\n\n\"We know that whale strandings are a natural phenomenon but we gave it a good go, spending the whole day in the water with those animals to give them the best opportunity,\" he added.\n\n\"Very hard to see. But this is nature, and it is a natural phenomenon that we do understand very little about.\"\n\nScientists do not fully understand why mass strandings occur, but pilot whales -- which can grow to more than six metres (20 feet) long -- are highly sociable, so they may follow pod-mates who stray into danger.",

    "body": "Madrid is the capital of Spain. At around 2nd century BC (BeforeChrist) Roman Empire established a settlement on the banks of the nearby river Manzanares. Still there are archaeological remains of Carpetani settlement and Roman villas. The city came to prominence during the Arab occupation from 711 to 1492 AD (Anno Domini)of the Iberian Peninsulacomprising present day Spain and Portugal. The city became the capital of Spain in the mid-16th century. Madrid has an inland Mediterranean climate. The warmest month is July. Its lifestyle has attracted many immigrants around the world.\n\nAfter getting Schengen visa I planned a trip to Madrid in the first week of December of 2016. Fortunately I was accompanied by one of my colleagues. We were travelling from Dubai by luxurious A 380 air bus. The aircraft have private suites in first class, flat-bed seats in business class and comfortable seats in economy class. Passengers in all classes can enjoy access to Wi-Fi, films, TV shows, music and satellite phone facilities. The flying hour was around 7 hour 30 minutes.Madrid unveiled its beauty while descending. We were dropped in terminal 4S (Satellite). The terminal have facilities like ATM's, currency exchange, medical services, phone cards, press office, VIP lounges, meeting rooms and prayer rooms. We were transported to terminal 4, which was more than 2 kilometers away by driverless automatic train. After completing passport formalities we came outside. This terminal is served by its own rail line and metro station.\n\nThe Madrid Metro line connects the airport with city centre. Other means of transport like bus, car rental and taxi services were also available. The airport is located 9 kilometers northeast of Madrid city centre.We purchased ticket from automated metro booth and our destination was station Nuevos Ministerios.Within few minutes the metro dropped us and we noticed the station was built with sufficient space, lighting and ample entryways.This station is located beneath the New Ministries complex.We refreshed ourselves and came outside.It was almost noon then.We were enchanted by the sudden splash of gentle breeze and by the beauty of this dream city. We started walking towards south.\n\nWe came across a beautiful fountain in Plaza de San Juan de la Cruz. Adjacent to this was The National Museum of Natural Science. It has research departments on biodiversity, evolutionary biology, evolutionary ecology, paleobiology, vulcanology, and geology. The streets of Madrid are a veritable museum of outdoor sculpture. Next we came across Centro cultural de la villa. It has theater, assembly hall and exhibitions hall. Its program of events includes theater, dance, music, children shows, exhibitions, talks, conferences and other activities. We saw a marble statue of famous explorer Christopher Columbus at the middle of the adjacent intersection which is really a traffic roundabout. The statue stands on a pretty large pedestal which has a number of reliefs depicting scenes related with his discovery of America carved on it. Columbus is seen wearing a tunic and cape. The statue is also holding a state flag in one hand and with the other is pointing to a particular direction. These impressive and tall statues visible from afar. At its south we saw the National Archaeological Museum. It has archaeological finds from prehistory to the 19th century, especially from the Iberian Peninsula. Its collections of Roman mosaics, Greek ceramics, Islamic art and Romanesque art are distributed in three floors.\n\nA little south of this we came across Cibeles Palace, which is now used as city hall or city council. It is a complex composed of two buildings with white facades. It was originally built in the early 20th century as the main office of the Spanish postal service. Presently exhibitions and cultural events also take place here. Its architecture is a combination of the gothic style with neoclassical elements. The building's facade is elaborately decorated with cartouches and pilasters. The Cibeles Square is just at its north.The famous marble fountain of Cibeles is placed at its centre. It also has a sculpture of a chariot pulled by two lions.\n\nThe famous via Calle de Alcala rd touched the adjacent roundabout. This road is of around 10.5 km in length and connected the western edge of the city with the northeastern outskirts. There are plenty of important buildings along this street, including a few theaters and palaces.\n\nFrom there strolling along the tree-lined avenue, we saw Prado Museum at our left. This place is quite picturesque in all seasons. Just at the opposite side of the road a lurking vertical garden or green wall attracted our attention. It was installed on renovated exterior wall of a former power station. It has small plants from different species and most of it was flourishing. Undoubtedly, the vertical garden is an incredible botanical sculpture, and a piece of unique artwork. We came to know that here PVC plates and metal frame covered with a polyamide felt were used to support the roots of the trees. As part of irrigation water or mist droplets are absorbed by the felt and the root system. Vertical garden gives rise to an urban oasis in dense concrete structures.\n\nAt its south east we saw The Palace of Fomento also known as the Ministry of Agriculture Building.It was completed in 1897. The most prominent part of this building is the main facade decorated with tiles, enamelwork, paintings and huge traditional sculpted columns. A group of statues can be seen on top of the building. The prominent Atocha railway station is located at its opposite side.We found a fountainmade of granite and white stoneat the Atocha roundabout. From here crossing the road we started walking towards west and our destination was nearby lavapies area.\n\nLavapies is the cultural melting pot and most bohemian neighborhood. It has become the focal point for immigrant populations coming from the Indian subcontinent, China, Middle East and Africa. Now its large immigrant population has given it an exotic, cosmopolitan flavor and it draws many visitors. We found many Indian restaurants here. The architecture of this area is uniform with similar height, windows, balconies, pastel colours and shop or apartment set up. Finally, the shop of my friend could be traced. After exchanging gratitude he took us to his nearby apartment. After light refreshment we planned to visit some more places. This time he took us toMuseo del Prado or the Prado Museum. The sun has set by then. Along the way there are several monuments and enclosures that are of historical and artistic interest.It is the main Spanish national art museum. It was founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819. It is widely considered to have one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century.The collection currently comprises paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings and historic documents. Here collections are displayed in more than 100 rooms on three floors. Trying to see all in one go was really daunting.The museum also has audio guided facilities.\n\nFrom there we went to the Puerta del Sol. This spacious town square is also a hub of public transportation. We saw the \"Kilometer Zero\" point from which all distances on the Spanish national road network are measured.This square witnessed many historic events, starting from the Spanish resistance to Napoleon on May 2nd 1808. Nowadays the square is a place to hang out and enjoy life. The square was very lively and full of spectacular lights as it was eve of Christmas. We saw a several-story high metal Christmas tree made of lights. Really shopping, food, bright lights and crowd gave festive look. At this square we also saw the bear and the madrone tree statue which is depicted on the Madrid coat of arms. After exchanging currency we returned to apartment. The tiring day terminated with a sound sleep.\n\nIn the next morning after breakfast we roamed around in the neighboring places. We were informed that the city has highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant in Europe. In many of the parks people enjoy cycling, walking, running and anaerobic exercise. We visited ruins of religious school Escuelas pias. It had a small library. The north side of the ruins faces the plaza augustin Lara, named after famous Mexican composer. We found a statue of him also in that area. Hiring a car we started for Toledo city, located 73 Kilometers south west of Madrid. This city observed historic co-existence of Muslims, Jews and Christians. The city still bears remnants of many Muslim glories. Here I observed so many things that it demands a separate write-up. On our way I marked here petrol pumps are fully automated. We returned at noon and had our lunch. After short leisure time at evening we left for Calle mendez Alvaro to catch bus for our next destination Paris.On way we were pinched by the cold breeze of winter.\n\nMy short trip in Madrid came to an end with many things still left to be seen. Spanish bullfight is also world famous. Madrid is home to football club giant Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.Plaza de Castilla, Buen Retiro Park and the Crystal Palace, Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor, Temple of Debod, Bernabeu Stadium, Puerta de Alcala are very prominent landmarks.

    "title": "New warning system to tackle landslide risk",
    "body": "A new system that can warn people of landslides nearly a week in advance is set to be launched in Bangladesh later this year, helping tackle increasing risks from a disaster linked to climate-change-driven extreme rainfall, experts said on Tuesday.\n\nDeveloped by the United Nations and Bangladesh's environment ministry, the warning system uses satellite imagery, rainfall measurements and other meteorological data to predict landslides in vulnerable regions.\n\nRight now, landslide alerts are provided more informally, based on rain-gauge readings, which amounts to \"now-casting, not forecasting\" and doesn't take into account geological data, said a UN Food and Agriculture Organization spokesman.\n\nInitially, the new alerts are likely to be introduced in May, when the monsoon season begins, in Cox's Bazar in southeast Bangladesh.\n\nBesides at-risk Bangladeshis, the area is home to nearly a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who have lived there since they fled their country in 2017.\n\nResearchers have gathered data on the area including soil properties and the history of landslides, as well as rainfall thresholds likely to trigger events, FAO officials said.\n\nThe information will be used to produce warnings at least five days in advance of expected landslides, they said.\n\nIf successful, the system - developed by the FAO and the International Organization for Migration - could be expanded to other parts of the country as well, they added.\n\nExperts on adapting to climate change said such warnings could save lives, particularly among the country's most vulnerable.\n\n\"Increased heavy downpours which may be due to climate change will definitely cause greater likelihood of more landslides in the hilly areas,\" said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development.\n\n\"It would be ... very important for the communities vulnerable to landslides to get warnings to enable them to survive,\" he added. Bangladesh is highly threatened by landslides, particularly during monsoon periods, and the number of disasters has been on the rise due to increasingly severe weather, losses of soil-holding trees and excavation work in hilly areas.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2018 landslides killed at least 700 people in the Chittagong Hill districts in southeastern Bangladesh, according to the FAO.\n\nThe low-lying nation is often included on lists of countries most at risk from the impacts of rising global temperatures, from more extreme storms to floods.\n\nScott Hussey, a spokesman for FAO, said it was important to remember \"that no early warning system related to any hazard can be 100% accurate\".\n\nMaking the system work effectively will require continual work to refine and upgrade it, as well as efforts to create better awareness of landslide risks among local communities, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via e-mail.\n\nSolaiman Haider, a senior official from Bangladesh's Department of Environment, said the system was promising but still in its early stages.\n\n\"We will come to know how well it works and to what extent people accept this during the monsoons,\" he said.",

    "body": "Discussion on tourism development between Bangladesh and Maldives held recently at Novo Tower in the capital organised by Novo Tours and Travels. The discussion was attended by tourism representatives of both countries: Shiruzimath Sameer, High Commissioner of the Republic of Maldives in Bangladesh, Guner Ureya, Ambassador of Kosovo to Bangladesh, Md Rafeeuzzaman, President, Shiblul Azam Koreshi, First Vice President of TOAB, S M Rahman, Managing Director of Novo Tours and Travels, and other high officials from the respective organisations.\n\nThe numbers of travellers visiting Maldives from Bangladesh is on the rise due to the convenient travel facilities the island country offers to Bangladesh such as visa on arrival and no need of prior hotel booking, apart from the amazing tourism facilities, activities and hospitality Maldives offers, said S M Rahman, Managing Director of Novo Tours and Travels. He mentioned that Maldives, with its serene sights and environment, beautiful island hotels and fun-filled water sports activities, has become one of the most sought-after honeymoon destinations for Bangladeshis. Also, it only takes a few hours to reach Maldives from Bangladesh with direct flights which further makes Maldives one of the most visited countries by Bangladeshis. Thus, tourism development between Bangladesh and Maldives is a dire need of time to further boost travel between the two countries.\n\nThis led to the discussion held between the tourism representatives of the two countries, claimed Rahman. For this purpose, Rahman proposed the national flag carrier Biman to consider operating direct flights to Maldives with the aim of catering to the growing demand of travel between Bangladesh and the island nation. Over 1 lac Bangladeshi work in Maldives, another market segment the local carriers of Bangladesh can grab, he expressed. If local carries start flying to Maldives this will create competition in the market and Maldivian Airlines, the only carrier to operate direct flights between Dhaka and Male, will then have to reduce its airfare which ultimately will facilitate more travel between the two countries, proposed Rahman.\n\nAt the discussion, representatives from the high commission of Maldives and TOAB carried out presentations on tourism potentials of the respective countries highlighting the promise of further development of tourism ties between the two. Managing Director of Novo Tours and Travels S M Rahman handed over crests to the High Commissioner of Maldives in Bangladesh, Guner Ureya, Ambassador of Kosovo to Bangladesh, Md Rafeeuzzaman, President of TOAB, Shiblul Azam Koreshi, First Vice President of TOAB and a little memento to the spouse of the High Commissioner of Maldives Ahmed Ishbah Gasim.",

It warned that even fully vaccinated passengers who have received a booster dose can spread the virus while onboard.\n\nThe CDC also recommended that cruise ship passengers be tested between one and three days prior to their voyage, and three to five days after, regardless of vaccination status.\n\nIt added that unvaccinated passengers should self-isolate for a week after disembarking.\n\nOn Wednesday, the CDC said it was monitoring 92 cruise ships for Covid-19 amid a spike in cases across the US.\n\nIt maintains a colour-coded chart for cruise ships on its website based on surveillance data from the previous seven days.\n\nShips that are marked \"red status\" are believed to contain a \"sustained transmission\" of the virus on-board.\n\nAs of Thursday, no vessels were marked with the red status.

    "body": "The issue of how to save the planet from global warming and efforts to mobilize action against climate change came under the spotlight at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos Agenda on Wednesday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of weakening international institutions and the threats of conflicts.\n\nONE EARTH, ONE SHARED FUTURE\n\nIn the “Mobilizing Action on Climate Change” session, Chinese Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu urged a united front in tackling the climate crisis.\n\n“There is only one Earth and one shared future for humanity. We need to work together because we are one community to face climate change. This is the most powerful tool,” Huang said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the “Financing the ‘Net-Zero’ Transition” panel, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said that “the world appears to be close to a new alignment to start flowing a mix of private and public investment funds” to enable the “net-zero” transformation of industries to zero carbon emissions.\n\nSwiss Re CEO Christian Mumenthaler stressed that even if companies may not know how to achieve “net-zero” by 2050, they should take “a leap of faith” and set the target that “I really feel we are at a tipping point in terms of action.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the WEF, the Energy Transitions Commission think tank, NGO Rocky Mountain Institute, and the We Mean Business coalition launched the Mission Possible Partnership in a bid to accelerate the decarbonization of heavy industry and transport.\n\nThe partnership, which brings together over 400 companies, builds on the work launched at the United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit in 2019 to help seven heavy industry sectors cut their carbon emissions, the WEF announced during the Davos Agenda meeting.\n\nPUTIN SPEECH\n\nDuring his special address on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the preexisting problems and imbalances.\n\n“We have every reason to believe that the tensions might aggravate further,” he said. “International institutions are weakening, regional conflicts are multiplying, the global security system is degrading.”\n\nReferring to the 20th century and the “catastrophic World War II”, Putin said that “nowadays, such a heated conflict is not possible. I hope that it\n\nis not possible in principle, because it will mean the end of our civilization.”\n\n“But I’d like to reiterate that the situation might develop unpredictably and uncontrollably if we sit on our hands doing nothing to avoid it. There’s\n\na possibility that we might experience an actual collapse of global development that might result in a fight of all against all.”\n\nPutin also called for more multilateralism, international dialogue and cooperation to tackle the current challenges.\n\nCOVID-19 THREAT\n\nOn Tuesday, Johns Hopkins University data showed that global COVID-19 cases surpassed 100 million.\n\nIn his special address, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called on the world to “further reinforce solidarity and collaboration” in the fight against the virus.\n\n“The economy is recovering, but the polarizations and inequities brought by the pandemic are growing even bigger. As COVID-19 is becoming more prolonged, inequality is widening a gap that we are witnessing both within countries and between countries,” he said.\n\nAccording to its latest World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund now forecasts the global economy to grow 5.5\n\npercent this year and expand by 4.2 percent in 2022, but warned that COVID-19 variants pose risks to the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nA special address planned for Wednesday by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the WEF was cancelled following his resignation the day before.\n\nThe virtual WEF Davos Agenda meeting, which usually takes place in the Swiss mountain town of Davos, lasts until Friday.",

    "body": "When the entire Bangladesh had been reeling under\n\nsweltering heatwave since the onset of the summer, rain lashed almost entire\n\ncountry for three consecutive days brings much needed respites from\n\nuncomfortable hot weather.\n\n\"Bangladesh including Khulna and Rajshahi division are witnessing rainfall\n\nwith thunderstorms. We are predicting more rains may occur across the\n\ncountry, Tariful Newaz Kabir, meteorologist of Bangladesh Meteorological\n\nDepartment (BMD) told BSS this morning.\n\nReferring to latest update data of BMD, he said the country will witness\n\nmoderate to heavy rainfall with thundershower till next week.\n\nThe long awaited rainfall has brought great relief for the people,\n\nparticularly working class segment of population including day laborers, the\n\nmeteorologist said adding the longest spell of heatwave beaching all time\n\nrecord in the history of Bangladesh severely affected life and livelihoods of\n\nthe working class people.\n\n\"Finally, we have got much needed relief from deadly heatwave ... analyzing\n\ndifferent indexes of long-term weather, Bangladesh will not face extreme\n\nheatwave event like previous month of April which saw record-breaking\n\nheatwave 28 days, except only two days of the entire month did not witness\n\nheatwave,\" Kabir added.\n\n\"Severe heatwave is unlikely to sweep over the country . . . but moderate to\n\nlight heatwave may prevail in southwestern and northwestern regions of the\n\ncountry from mid-May,\" Omar Faruq, meteorologist of Bangladesh Meteorological\n\nDepartment(BMD), told BSS on May 7.\n\nHe said the entire country may witness heavy to very heavy rainfall along\n\nwith thunderstorms (locally known Kalboishaki) from May 7 and it will\n\ncontinue till May 14 meaning temperature will continue to fall during the\n\nperiod.\n\nOn April 26, Bangladesh set all-time heatwave record as the Met Office\n\nrecorded 24 days of heatwave breaching previous 23 days of heatwave in 2019.\n\n\"Twenty-three days of heatwave were logged during two months of April and May\n\nin 2019, which were considered the prolonged heatwave in the history of the\n\ncountry. But the April alone crossed the grim milestone setting new record of\n\nheatwave days,\" BMD meteorologist Dr Abul Kalam Mallik said.\n\nExplaining the three key indexes of hot weather - - heatwave, severe heatwave\n\nand very severe heatwave, the BMD meteorologist said, \"We consider\n\ntemperatures above 36 degrees Celsius for at least two consecutive days as\n\nheatwave while temperatures between 40 degrees and 42 degrees are severe\n\nheatwave and temperature of above 42 degree Celsius is very severe heatwave.\"\n\nThe weather expert said earlier, the western and northern regions -- Khulna,\n\nRajshahi, Rangpur of Bangladesh are considered heatwave-prone areas. Some\n\nsouth-western parts of Barishal division and Dhaka division experienced\n\nheatwave, he continued.\n\n\"Since the 90s, days of heatwave have been increasing alarmingly in\n\nBangladesh giving a clear signal that the country may face prolonged heatwave\n\nin future . . . Simultaneously heatwave is spreading across the country,\"\n\nMallik added.\n\n\"Once, heatwave was confined in the western, northern and central parts of\n\nBangladesh. But this year the entire country is witnessing heatwave. It means\n\nweather pattern in Bangladesh has changed drastically extending heatwave\n\ncoverage areas with its intensity,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the BMD collected data, 18 days of heatwave were recorded\n\nbetween April 13 and 14 in Dhaka in 1999, 13 days of heatwave were posted in\n\nDhaka in May in 2004 and 18 days, 19 days, 20 days of heatwave in Jashore in\n\n2014, 2016 and 2017 respectively.\n\nThe BMD also added that 13, 10, 17 days and 13 days of heatwave were reported\n\nin 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2022 in Rajshahi respectively while 19 and 23 days of\n\nheatwave in 2014 and 2019 respectively in Chudanga.\n\n\"Khulna and Rajshahi divisions bore the brunt of the heatwave as maximum\n\ntemperatures above 40 degree Celsius were recorded in most weather stations\n\nat the beginning of last month,\" Bazlur Rashid, meteorologist of Bangladesh\n\nMeteorological Department (BMD) said.\n\n\"Finally, Khulna division recorded heavy rainfall since Monday while another\n\nhardest-hit Rajshahi region received little rainfall on May 6,\" the\n\nmeteorologist forecasted rainfall is likely to occur in Rashahi and Khulna\n\ndivisions.\n\nJashore and Chuadanga experienced highest temperature in almost every day\n\nsince the sweltering heatwave blasted the country since the onset of the\n\nsummer this year sending mercury as high as nearly 44 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe year's highest temperature of 43.8 degrees Celsius was recorded in the\n\nsouthwestern district of Jashore on April 30 while the second highest\n\ntemperature of 43.7 degrees Celsius was recorded in another south-western\n\ndistrict of Chuadanga.\n\nEchoing the comments of Tariful Newaz Kabir, BMD meteorologist said when the\n\nentire Bangladesh is grappling with a brutal heatwave since April 1 setting\n\nall-time record of prolonged heatwave days, much of the country witnessed\n\nsignificant rainfall with thunderstorms.\n\nRainfalls of three consecutive two days have brought much needed relief\n\nbringing down average temperature by three to four degrees Celsius across the\n\ncountry, Monwar said adding mercury has dipped significantly at some weather\n\nstations up to six degrees Celsius meaning very cool weather is prevailing\n\nalmost entire country.\n\nUnlike previous month of April, residents will get respite from blistering\n\nheatwave throughout the month of May as mercury will maintain the tolerable\n\ntemperature with impact of rainfall and thunderstorms, the BMD meteorologist\n\nadded.\n\nAccording to the weather bulletin issued by BMD on May 7, Dhaka city and its\n\nadjacent districts recorded a significant amount of rainfall, he said adding,\n\n\"The Met Office recorded 97mm at Madaripur, 63mm at Gopalganj,”\n\nThe country's highest rainfall was recorded in Feni with 130 mm while 118 mm\n\nwere recorded in Chattogram, 70mm at Swandip, 57mm at Sitakunda, 89mm at\n\nChandpur, 33mm at Bandarban, 75mm at Khulna, 67mm at Sathkhira, 25mm at\n\nJashore, 75 mm at Barishal, 45 at Patuakhali, 80 mm at Khepupara, 69mm at\n\nBhola, 63mm at Sylhet, the bulletin added.\n\nMonwar said after mid-May, mild to moderate heatwave will sweep some regions\n\nincluding Khulna and Rajshahi and \"We are expecting Bangladesh will not face\n\ndeadly heatwave like the month of April.\"\n\nMallik suggested avoiding to stay outdoors during the hailstorm as intensity\n\nof hailstorms is increasing accompanied with frequent lightning impacted by\n\nclimate change, which are largely responsible for casualties.\n\nThe Met Office recorded 34.6 degrees Celsius on May 7 at Jeshore while the\n\ntemperature in Dhaka was recorded at 32.6 degrees Celsius during the same\n\nday.\n\nVisibly for the first time the meteorologists acknowledged that the climate\n\nchange phenomenon caused the erratic weather pattern with gradually expanding\n\nareas of heatwave, joining the voice with the climate experts and activists.",

    "body": "The International Republican Institute (IRI) described the Bangladesh's February 12 parliamentary elections as a significant milestone in the country's democratic transition.\n\n\"Security forces and the Election Commission performed admirably. After years of authoritarian rule, Election Day was mostly peaceful and incident-free. Given the historical context, that is a big step forward for Bangladesh,\" said former United States Congressman David Dreier who led the IRI delegation as polls observer in Bangladesh.\n\nIRI deployed a high-level delegation of international observers to Dhaka from February 9 to 13 to assess the conduct of the 2026 parliamentary elections, said an IRI statement on Saturday. \"Given the historical context, that is a big step forward for Bangladesh,\" Dreier said. The IRI delegation, in its preliminary findings, said the polls marked \"an inflection point\" for Bangladesh as it navigates a complex democratic transition following the July 2024 uprising that ended more than 15 years of Awami League rule.\n\n\"Now that the election is over, the hard work of governing lies ahead and the enthusiasm of the Bangladeshi people needs to be translated into action,\" Dreier added. The delegation observed that while election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile.\n\nIt encouraged political candidates to resolve disputes through legal channels in the immediate post-election period.\n\nAccording to the IRI's preliminary findings, the pre-election period was relatively peaceful compared to previous electoral cycles, although clashes occurred across multiple districts involving rival party supporters.\n\nVoter turnout stood at 59 percent, marking a significant increase from the previous parliamentary election. Many first-time voters, particularly those under 35, participated in the vote. However, it said, concerns remain regarding the historical undercounting of women on voter rolls. The Election Commission was commended for substantial logistical preparedness and professional execution of a complex national operation.\n\nThe Commission's operational transparency was described as notable progress compared to prior election cycles.\n\nReforms such as the introduction of postal voting for Bangladeshis living abroad, the establishment of criteria for accrediting citizen observers, and a nationwide voter education campaign were seen as measures that enhanced transparency and credibility.\n\nStrong participation by political party polling agents, citizen observers and international monitors ensured a high level of transparency at many polling stations.\n\nThe report expressed concern over the significant underrepresentation of women, ethnic and religious minorities among candidates.\n\nNo widespread or systematic targeting of minority communities was observed on Election Day, said the report.\n\nOn Election Day, voting largely commenced on time, essential materials were available, and presiding officers were professional.\n\nPolling stations generally closed on schedule, and counting and tabulation were described as transparent and efficient, the report said.\n\nThe election was conducted under heightened security, with deployment of police, army units, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion, Ansar and village defence forces nationwide.\n\nAuthorities designated thousands of polling centres as \"high risk\" and implemented layered security measures. These steps appeared to contain isolated incidents and prevent escalation.\n\nIRI, which has led or supported more than 270 election observation missions globally, will continue to monitor the post-election process and issue a comprehensive final report with detailed analysis and recommendations, said the release.",

    "body": "Chief Adviser's Special Assistant Professor Ali Riaz today urged the political parties to implement the reforms showing respect to the referendum verdict, noting the overwhelming 'Yes' vote in the referendum reflects clear people's mandate for reform.\n\n\"The citizens of Bangladesh gave, in a clear and unequivocal manner, their verdict for the constitutional reform proposals contained in the July National Charter,\" he said.\n\nProf Riaz added: \"The verdict demonstrates that a large majority of citizens do not wish to return to the old system or maintain the status quo. Instead, they want change and reform in state structure\".\n\nHe made the remarks at a press briefing at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka on Saturday morning, BSS reports.\n\nNoting that responsibility for implementing the clear public mandate for reform now rests with the political parties, Prof Riaz said all political parties are committed to state reform.\n\nHe called on the ruling party-elect, parties to be representing in parliament and the Constitutional Reform Council, as well as parties outside parliament, to ensure implementation of the referendum verdict through dialogue and unity.\n\nProf Riaz also urged political parties to continue the respect for differing opinions, tolerance, and tradition of compromise that was demonstrated during discussions at the National Consensus Commission. \"The verdict represents recognition of the responsibility entrusted to us by those who gave their lives, were injured, and fought fearlessly during the July-August mass uprising in 2024. It reflects the people's commitment to fulfilling that responsibility,\" he said. Following the nearly 16 years marked by bloodshed, repression, and the cries of the persecuted, Prof Riaz said the referendum expressed a people's aspiration for forming an institutional framework so that such suffering is never repeated.\n\n\"The responsibility of implementing the people-endorsed document, drafted by the political parties themselves, now lies on you,\" he said referring to the political parties. Prof Riaz also called on civil society to support and advance the process. Addressing young people in particular, he urged them to take the lead in building the future Bangladesh.\n\nReferring to the figures of voter turnout in the referendum, Prof Riaz stressed that the referendum result should not be viewed merely in numerical terms.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to all for extending the wide-ranging support during the awareness campaign on referendum.\n\nProf Riaz specially mentioned the families of the July martyrs, July fighters, July political detainees, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, Sushashoner Jonno Nagorik (SUJAN), groups advocating for increasing the age limit for government jobs, and general students, saying, they took the initiative to organize and campaign actively in support of the referendum. He also thanked media professionals and journalists for their efforts in creating public awareness about the referendum and expressed appreciation for those who criticized the procedures and methods of the referendum, stating that all voices-positive and negative-are essential elements of a democratic society.\n\nProf Riaz congratulated the newly elected Members of Parliament and their respective political parties.\n\nHe also congratulated the public for participating in large numbers in what he described as a genuine election after a long period, thereby defeating all forms of conspiracy and fears of violence.\n\nReplying to a question from a journalist whether BNP would implement all the reforms contained in the July Charter, Prof Riaz said he hoped BNP would show respect to the people's mandate as it has previous records of adopting major reforms initiatives.\n\nChief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam and Deputy Press Secretary Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad Majumder were present at the briefing.",

    "title": "Terror Menace in Pakistan",
    "body": "Pakistan reeled under a well-coordinated string of deadly terror attacks across Baluchistan on January 31 involving twelve cities including its capital Quetta and Gwadar, Mastung, Panjgur, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Tump and Pasni. There have been casualties on several security personnel also. The authorities claim to have killed many civilians thought to be Baluch separatists. The official Pakistani media has blamed a relatively new entity call Fitna-al-Hindustan for carrying out such lethal terror assaults. Fitna-al-Hindustan is a phrase coined by the establishment itself pointing towards the allegedly India backed outlawed Baluch Liberation Army (BLA).\n\nMost significantly, the January 31 terror attack occurred in a resource rich area where Pakistan is seeking to attract foreign investments in mining and minerals. In September last year, an American metals company had signed a five hundred million USD investment agreement and soon after the US State Department designated BLA and its arms wing as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Foreign Affairs magazine writing in a recent piece, there is a sharp increase in spate of terror attacks in Pakistan ever since the Taliban has returned in power in August 2021. The magazine further described Pakistan Afghanistan border as the most worrisome flash point in South Asia today and assessed that Pakistan could face even deadlier terrorist attacks in the near future. Simultaneously, Islamabad has also stated that terrorism emanating from Kabul has reached an intolerable level.\n\nFurther, according to Foreign Affairs, which cited data from the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, year 2025 marked Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade. These organizations reported a sharp rise in attacks, largely attributed to groups including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The Foreign Affairs also indicated that repeated mediation efforts facilitated by - Qatar, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia – have failed miserably to secure a lasting commitment from the Taliban to control the TTP. The report also indicates that Taliban appears unwilling to act against the group due to close ideological and operational ties. It further noted that the Taliban may leverage confrontation with Pakistan to bolster its domestic legitimacy.\n\nReacting to the latest terror attack in Baluchistan, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, accused Taliban authorities of sheltering militant groups. Speaking to “Dawn” (the most widely read English newspaper in Pakistan), he specifically highlighted what he called India’s longstanding “support” for proxy elements operating from the Afghan soil. Ahmad further said the UN Secretary-general had quite rightly pointed out earlier this week that the international community expects the Taliban to ensure Afghan soil is not used for cross-border attacks. He noted that this commitment was central to the original Doha process but remains unfulfilled. According to him, this undertaking has not been fulfilled and the Taliban have failed to do so. Ahmad also noted that a UN Monitoring Team has reported on the presence of anti-Pakistan groups in the neighboring country. As per Ahmad, the large presence of the TTP in Afghanistan, together with BLA, Fitna-al-Hindustan, and their terrorist acts against Pakistan from Afghan soil, have also been reported by the UN Monitoring Team. In the same vein, he admitted an exponential rise in attacks originating from across the border.\n\nExperts also reckon that tensions within have been further complicated due to warming ties between the Taliban and India. This engagement, the security professionals say, coinciding with the surge in violence inside Pakistan, could complicate regional security dynamics in a big way.\n\nIn the meantime, think tanks in Pakistan give out that the sophistication of the strikes indicates that the militants are will trained, and endorse the country’s suspicions that hostile actors in the region are stirring up trouble in Baluchistan. Yet, it is also a matter of concern that the terrorists were able to hit such a large number of towns, including the provincial capital, which is thought to be well protected. The seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the Interior Minister rushing in panic to Baluchistan soon after the attack to assess the situation. They further opined that this pattern of violence in Baluchistan is not new. Last year’s assault targeting the Jaffar Express, as well as a similar coordinated terror campaign in August 2024, exhibits that despite the State’s counterterrorism efforts, the problem of terror violence remains unresolved in this turbulent province and elsewhere.\n\nSo far, there were over 250 terrorist attacks in Baluchistan last year, causing over 400 fatalities. Along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the province is the hardest hit by terrorist violence in the country. This atmosphere of violence and uncertainty exacerbates the socio-economic woes of Baluchistan and retards development. Security strategists recommend that while the immediate focus should be on sanitization operations so that all affected areas are declared safe, the administration must consider long term to bring lasting peace in Baluchistan as no ideology can justify the murder of innocent people as women and children also died in the latest attacks. Hence, the authorities must neutralize all those violent actors responsible for these acts. It is also analyzed and alleged that in the past, Baluch terrorists have regularly indulged in brutal slayings of non-locals. Moreover, the links of the terrorist groups with “hostile foreign actors” need to be broken and greater vigilance needed at the country’s borders to prevent terrorists from entering the country.\n\nWe can see from the accusations and allegations that there is considerable insinuation pointing fingers towards India. Such charges look preposterous and without any basis or evidence. These hollow claims also expose the Pakistan’s misconception that it is in the good books of the US administration and all is hunky-dory. In fact, internally Pakistan is unable to tackle the terror menace.\n\nThe violence continues to surge and unless Baluch problem is adequately addressed, TTP brought on the negotiating table and relations with Afghanistan improved, such attacks will continue to occur at regular intervals. The partners in the recently concluded Pakistan-Turkiye and Saudi Arabia tri-nation pact will also be a helpless watcher to the incessant terror attacks.\n\nShantanu Mukharji is a retired IPS officer\n\nand former National Security Advisor in\n\nMauritius.

    "body": "Dasha Anastasya\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s actions and incendiary remarks in the first year of his second presidential term have left many women, people of color and their allies in a tailspin.\n\nShortly after re-entering office, he released executive orders that attacked diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, and transgender rights. His January orders that called for an end to DEI and affirmative action led to thousands of cuts in the private and public sectors – and shake-ups within the journalism industry. One directive that banned access to gender-affirming care for youth under the age of 19 sent families into a flurry as they scrambled to ensure that their trans kids continued to receive treatment. Another executive order directed his vice-president, JD Vance, to prohibit federal spending on Smithsonian programs or exhibits that focused on race. He also worked to suppress Indigenous history by again changing the name of the mountain Denali in the Athabascan language to Mount McKinley. And his mass deportation operations have torn families apart.\n\nAlong with his federal policies, Trump also shared racist, xenophobic and sexist comments during speeches, press meetings and on his social media platform, Truth Social, throughout the year.\n\nWhen Donald Trump’s administration left office in 2020, two-thirds of surveyed Americans agreed that Trump had increased racial tensions in the United States. The backdrop for that widespread sentiment was the Trump administration’s sustained assault on political, civic, and legal efforts to promote racial justice; Trump’s consistent use of inflammatory racist rhetoric; and his transparent pursuit of a white supremacist agenda rooted in racial grievance.\n\nIn some cases ethnicity and nationalism were harnessed to wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians). As Benedict Anderson has suggested in Imagined Communities, ethnic identity and ethno-nationalism took the shape of a breeding ground for animosity within such empires with the rise of print-capitalism.\n\nIn its modern form, racism gradually mounted with European discoveries and conquest of much of the rest of the world, and especially after Christopher Columbus had explored the American continent. As new different places and their inhabitants were confronted, fought and ultimately subjugated, theories about \"race\" began to develop. Another probable source of racism is the deliberate or unwilling misapprehension of Charles Darwin's theories of evolution.\n\nSome intellectuals took Darwin's theories to denote that since some \"races\" were more civilized, there must be a biological basis for the difference. At the same time they appealed to biological theories of moral and intellectual traits to impart a 'legal' platform to racism.\n\nEurope has witnessed the rise of neo-Nazism since 1990s which suggests that far from being a sporadic activity, racism, violence and radical nationalism have become normal in some communities. The problems could have been tackled much earlier in schools and with social programs, but the concerned government authorities also seem to lack the true desire to remove racism. In this way, racist discontentment often flares up in most terrible ways in the west between the white fellows and black or coloured immigrants all on a sudden.\n\nEthnic minorities in one country can often be abused as a scapegoat by the majority during times of economic crisis. That is one reason why Nazism remains so popular in countries like Germany, Greece and Russia till today. Vicious, murderous racists called 'skinheads' are common on the streets of Russia, Germany, even in a relatively safer and more peaceful country like Finland, who prey on non-white foreigners every now and then.\n\nRacist attacks and sentiments have further spread in the west due to the unresolved Palestinian issue in the Middle East where Arabs and Jews have been on extremely antagonistic terms for over 60 years. South Africa is still suffering intermittent racial riots between black and white citizens despite the fact that this was supposed to have ended up through the victory of Nelson Mandela as the President who came with a strong optimism to eliminate apartheid in his country.\n\nThe pernicious riots of 2011 in London and other cities of England also originated from racism when Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old black young man was shot dead by some English policemen. Thousands of vehicles, shops and restaurants were plundered, vandalized and burnt by unruly people which is a glaring indication of their outrage at the discrimination they have been facing in England for ages.\n\nOf late, racist skirmishes have erupted in some parts of the United States too following the murders of some black Americans. A terrific racist mayhem broke out in France in 2006 as a result of the killings of two African immigrants by French cops. So, racist hazards and mishaps have been destabilizing the west every now and then.\n\nRacism was deplored by the leading authors of the United States in their books during the 19th Century while the Americans were fighting against their fellow countrymen to eliminate slavery of the black community. Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Alex Haley, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and John Steinbeck touched the hearts of millions of readers worldwide with their tremendous anti-slavery novels.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper, one of the earliest fiction writers of America, narrated vividly in his novels The Last of the Mohicans and The Leather-Stocking Tales how the white Europeans got involved in armed combats with the Native American tribes during the initial days of settlement.\n\nA highly remarkable event regarding literature addressing racism is the Harlem Renaissance that bloomed in the United States during 1920 to 1940. The Harlem Renaissance triggered a profuse outburst of the artistic, philosophical and literary feats of a cluster of Afro-American litterateurs.\n\nPoets, artists and authors who thrived during the Harlem Renaissance added a massive power to the literary and cultural drive of the African masses living in major American cities. It brought about an avalanche of stories, essays, verses and artworks by some black Americans illustrating their thoughts and visions of life.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance was a resurrection of African values amid the white-dominated American academia. The pioneers of the Harlem Renaissance are Sterling Brown, Robert Hayden, James Mercer Hughes, Clarissa Scott, James Baldwin, Rudolph Fisher, Hubert Harrison and some more.\n\nSouthern Road, The Last Ride of Wild Bill, The Walls of Jericho, Nigger Heaven are some of the memorable literary works generated during the Harlem Renaissance. The Souls of Black Folk is another valuable book on the racial issues of America written by William Du Bois, a Professor of Sociology in Atlanta University during the initial years of 20th century.\n\nRacism and apartheid formulated the themes of some outstanding novels by two top-brass South African authors J.M. Coetzee and Nadine Gordimer. Both of them received Nobel Prize for their stunning literary works. Disgrace by J. M. Coetzee fictionalizes a post-apartheid South Africa where the white inhabitants are cornered and assailed by their black counterparts.\n\nNadine Gordimer's July's People tells the story of a civil war in a fictitious land where several white people take shelter in the home of a black fellow who used to be their slave once upon a time. A radical shift in the conventional racial scenario is the most notable tenet of both these novels.\n\nRacism has been touched upon by some oriental authors too. Mulk Raj Anand addressed the subhuman lives of lower-caste porters and workers of India in his masterpieces Untouchable and Coolie. Arundhati Roy's books The God of Small Things, The Shape of the Beast and Listening to Grasshoppers also strongly castigate the racial and communal viewpoints of the upper class people of India. Edward Said, the most eminent orientalist of the world also focused on some race-oriented controversies in his books Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism.\n\nNoam Chomsky once said, \"The police can go to downtown Harlem and pick up a kid with a joint in the streets. But they can't go into the elegant apartments and get a stockbroker who's sniffing cocaine.\" Since Harlem is mostly inhabited by black people, the American law-enforcement agencies are always found squeezing that place harder but the same thing doesn't happen in other areas of the United States where wealthy white people reside-that's how we can interpret the above words by Noam Chomsky.\n\nRacism is still a major social stigma in the United States where discrimination against the Afro-Americans, non-white immigrants and Hispanics are common phenomena. Even Barack Obama, who is the first ever black man to have won the presidential polls in the USA, also faced racist expletives and catcalls during his presidential campaign several years back.\n\nState and local officials can mobilize to protect democracy and continue civil rights gains in the face of a hostile Trump administration. Indeed, since July 2023 state attorneys general have issued two opinions as a coalition to “condemn attempts to correlate diversity measures with racial discrimination, and to remind companies of their obligations to ensure equitable and inclusive environments for their employees and clients.” Governors and mayors can also continue the advancement of civil rights protections in the public sector by issuing executive orders to create and expand state-and locally-funded DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programs. Finally, state legislators and city council members should thwart attacks on DEI by voting against proposals to restrict funding for DEI programs, holding hearings concerning public and private sector DEI programs and the negative impacts of dismantling them, and proposing bills that advance DEI goals.\n\nDasha Anastasya is a bilingual\n\nauthor and interpreter in the\n\nUN Office in South Africa.",

    "title": "Empire Illusions: What British Rule Really Did for India",
    "body": "An illustration of British soldiers capturing Bahadur Shah II, the last Mughal Emperor, in 1857. Pictorial Press Ltd\n\nAmartya Sen\n\nThe British Empire in India was in effect established at the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757. The battle was swift, beginning at dawn and ending close to sunset. It was a normal monsoon day, with occasional rain in the mango groves at the town of Plassey, which is between Calcutta, where the British were based, and Murshidabad, the capital of the kingdom of Bengal. It was in those mango groves that the British forces faced the Nawab Siraj-ud-Doula’s army and convincingly defeated it.\n\nBritish rule ended nearly 200 years later with Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous speech on India’s “tryst with destiny” at midnight on 14 August 1947. Two hundred years is a long time. What did the British achieve in India, and what did they fail to accomplish?\n\nDuring my days as a student at a progressive school in West Bengal in the 1940s, these questions came into our discussion constantly. They remain important even today, not least because the British Empire is often invoked in discussions about successful global governance. It has also been invoked to try to persuade the US to acknowledge its role as the pre-eminent imperial power in the world today: “Should the United States seek to shed – or to shoulder – the imperial load it has inherited?” the historian Niall Ferguson has asked. It is certainly an interesting question, and Ferguson is right to argue that it cannot be answered without an understanding of how the British Empire rose and fell – and what it managed to do.\n\nArguing about all this at Shantiniketan School, which had been established by Rabindranath Tagore some decades earlier, we were bothered by a difficult methodological question. How could we think about what India would have been like in the 1940s had British rule not occurred at all?\n\nThe frequent temptation to compare India in 1757 (when British rule was beginning) with India in 1947 (when the British were leaving) would tell us very little, because in the absence of British rule, India would of course not have remained the same as it was at the time of Plassey. The country would not have stood still had the British conquest not occurred. But how do we answer the question about what difference was made by British rule?\n\nTo illustrate the relevance of such an “alternative history”, we may consider another case – one with a potential imperial conquest that did not in fact occur. Let’s think about Commodore Matthew Perry of the US navy, who steamed into the bay of Edo in Japan in 1853 with four warships. Now consider the possibility that Perry was not merely making a show of American strength (as was in fact the case), but was instead the advance guard of an American conquest of Japan, establishing a new American empire in the land of the rising sun, rather as Robert Clive did in India. If we were to assess the achievements of the supposed American rule of Japan through the simple device of comparing Japan before that imperial conquest in 1853 with Japan after the American domination ended, whenever that might be, and attribute all the differences to the effects of the American empire, we would miss all the contributions of the Meiji restoration from 1868 onwards, and of other globalizing changes that were going on. Japan did not stand still; nor would India have done so.\n\nWhile we can see what actually happened in Japan under Meiji rule, it is extremely hard to guess with any confidence what course the history of the Indian subcontinent would have taken had the British conquest not occurred. Would India have moved, like Japan, towards modernisation in an increasingly globalizing world, or would it have remained resistant to change, like Afghanistan, or would it have hastened slowly, like Thailand?\n\nThese are impossibly difficult questions to answer. And yet, even without real alternative historical scenarios, there are some limited questions that can be answered, which may contribute to an intelligent understanding of the role that British rule played in India. We can ask: what were the challenges that India faced at the time of the British conquest, and what happened in those critical areas during the British rule?\n\nThere was surely a need for major changes in a rather chaotic and institutionally backward India. To recognize the need for change in India in the mid-18th century does not require us to ignore – as many Indian super-nationalists fear – the great achievements in India’s past, with its extraordinary history of accomplishments in philosophy, mathematics, literature, arts, architecture, music, medicine, linguistics and astronomy. India had also achieved considerable success in building a thriving economy with flourishing trade and commerce well before the colonial period – the economic wealth of India was amply acknowledged by British observers such as Adam Smith.\n\nThe fact is, nevertheless, that even with those achievements, in the mid-18th century India had in many ways fallen well behind what was being achieved in Europe. The exact nature and significance of this backwardness were frequent subjects of lively debates in the evenings at my school.\n\nAn insightful essay on India by Karl Marx particularly engaged the attention of some of us. Writing in 1853, Marx pointed to the constructive role of British rule in India, on the grounds that India needed some radical re-examination and self-scrutiny. And Britain did indeed serve as India’s primary western contact, particularly in the course of the 19th century. The importance of this influence would be hard to neglect. The indigenous globalised culture that was slowly emerging in India was deeply indebted not only to British writing, but also to books and articles in other – that is non-English – European languages that became known in India through the British.\n\nFigures such as the Calcutta philosopher Ram Mohan Roy, born in 1772, were influenced not only by traditional knowledge of Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian texts, but also by the growing familiarity with English writings. After Roy, in Bengal itself there were also Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Madhusudan Dutta and several generations of Tagores and their followers who were re-examining the India they had inherited in the light of what they saw happening in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their main – often their only – source of information were the books (usually in English) circulating in India, thanks to British rule. That intellectual influence, covering a wide range of European cultures, survives strongly today, even as the military, political and economic power of the British has declined dramatically.\n\nI was persuaded that Marx was basically right in his diagnosis of the need for some radical change in India, as its old order was crumbling as a result of not having been a part of the intellectual and economic globalization that the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution had initiated across the world (along with, alas, colonialism).\n\nAt the time of the Battle of Plassey, there were already businessmen, traders and other professionals from a number of different European nations well settled near the mouth of the Ganges. Being subjected to imperial rule is thus not the only way of making connections with, or learning things from, foreign countries. When the Meiji Restoration established a new reformist government in Japan in 1868 (which was not unrelated to the internal political impact of Commodore Perry’s show of force a decade earlier), the Japanese went straight to learning from the west without being subjected to imperialism. They sent people for training in the US and Europe, and made institutional changes that were clearly inspired by western experience. They did not wait to be coercively globalized via imperialism.\n\nAmartya Sen is a Professor of\n\nHarvard University and a\n\nNobel laureate economist.\n\nCourtesy: The Guardian",

    "title": "Eco-Friendly Industrialization Must Be Promoted",
    "body": "Rifat Rafique Badhan\n\nBack in 2023 a Bangladeshi factory Green Textile Limited located in Bhaluka, Mymensingh has been recognized as the number one or top eco-friendly factory in the world. According to media report, the US Green Building Council (USGBC) has been recognized quality certificate as an environmentally friendly factory. Last February 21, the USGBC issued the prestigious certificate and the factory received 104 out of 110 marks in various criteria for environmentally friendly factories. More glorious news is that according to the latest USGBC list, 8 of the world's top 10 eco-friendly factories are in Bangladesh and the remaining two are in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. As of 2018, Indonesia had the world's most environmentally friendly factory. The factory then got 101 out of 110 marks. Moreover, 52 out of the top 100 environmentally friendly factories in the world are in Bangladesh and 10 factories in China are in the second position. Then Pakistan has 9 factories, Sri Lanka and India have 6 each with 12 and Vietnam and Taiwan have 4 and 8 factories each.\n\nCurrently, the importance, popularity and necessity of green factories or industry in the world is increasing at an appreciable rate due global brand. According to BGMEA, our country has 183 certified green factories as of December 2022, the highest compared to other countries, and another 500 factories are in the pipeline to be certified soon. Out of 183 garment and textile factories in Bangladesh, 60 have got Lead Platinum, 109 Gold, 10 Silver and 4 certified. Last year, a total of 27 companies in the ready-made garments and textiles sector received the certificate of eco-friendly factories.\n\nGenerally, green factories are built in compliance with all relevant international standards. Energy and water conservation, construction in compliance with building codes and proper waste management are given utmost importance while setting up such factories. It is important to keep solar power source, light with sensor, bicycle stand for energy saving, rainwater harvesting, water recycling systems, taps with sensors to reduce water wastage and modern sanitary fittings are essential to save water. Not only this, a green factory has to maintain indoor air quality as per ASHRAE standards. Besides, the temperature inside the factory is controlled to a tolerable level, which plays a role in maintaining the good health and productivity of a worker.\n\nThe primary foundation of a green factory is efficient and sustainable production, which balances environmental and business interests. All USGBC guidelines are preferred while setting up green factories. A factory is required to receive certification from the USGBC by achieving minimum standards in six specific areas prescribed by the USGBC to become Lead Certified. These include sustainable sites, efficient water management and electricity use, improved working environment, etc. If an industry or factory passes this standard then the factory gets the lead certificate based on the given marks. For example, when a factory building gets 80 or more points, it is certified as a Lead Platinum building in UG, similarly 70 or more is certified as Gold and 60 or more as Silver. Sustainable design is the key to green factories. In this process, maximum production is ensured in a fair working environment by utilizing natural resources in a cost-effective manner. The establishment is evaluated on a total of 110 points in various categories.\n\nThe reality is that setting up or renovating a green factory is very expensive. Advanced technology materials are used to make it. For example VOC Free Point, RUG Certified, FSC Certified, ASHRAE, Energy Star etc. international standard products are to be used. As a result, setting up a green factory costs at least 20-30 percent more than a normal factory. But since setting up a green factory is part of a long-term plan, the investment in this case is profitable in all respects and is quite important for international reputation and reputation. So we should make the policy of green finance easier. However, the USGBC's Green Factory policy places great importance on the working environment of the workers and thereby makes the working environment more pleasant for the workers. Workers also feel comfortable working in green infrastructure due to adequate light and ventilation, advanced machinery and modern facilities.\n\nIn our country mainly after the Tazreen Garments fire and the Rana Plaza collapse, foreign buyers started canceling purchase orders one after another. They even pressured the closure of the country's garment factories by alleging non-compliance. Accord and Alliance, a coalition of European and American buyers, visited the garment factories of Bangladesh at various times, creating fear among the entrepreneurs and causing great discomfort among the entrepreneurs. Later on, due to the constructive initiatives taken by the industrial owners, the uncertain situation has gradually been removed and a very favorable situation has been created and many readymade garment manufacturers are turning towards green industrialization.\n\nA significant feature of the concept of green industrialization is the protection of the environment. It is considered a difficult challenge to run the production process in an environment friendly, electricity, water and gas saving, healthy environment, but this challenge can be met through the implementation of green industrialization concept. Our garment sector has to face tough competition with other countries in the international arena. Our readymade garment sector has to move ahead despite many hurdles, setbacks, conspiracies. Globally now everyone has to pay special attention to environmental protection. Garment buyer countries and international organizations and groups are now imposing environmental and labor-friendly conditions in the garment production process. Their satisfaction can only be achieved by fulfilling the conditions and for this now, compliance has to be given special importance in the garment industry. In the past this issue has been kind of ignored. Pressure from foreign buyers has also played a major role in the growing popularity of the concept of green industrialization.\n\nThere is no alternative to sustainable development to survive in the global market. Therefore, to strengthen our position in the global market, we must focus on environmentally friendly production systems. Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) formulation and implementation should be looked at more seriously, along with financing green industrialization. Consumers worldwide are increasingly interested in sustainable and low carbon footprint clothing, and popular fashion brands are also trying to woo consumers with their renewed commitment to eco-friendly clothing. Bangladesh is one of the low carbon emitting countries in the world, yet it is gaining recognition in the world as a renewable energy consuming country. Bangladesh has the largest number of solar home systems. Renewable energy is becoming increasingly popular in Bangladesh's garment industry. BGMEA has already signed ENFCC's initiative Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the apparel sector by 30 percent by 2030.\n\nIn the continuation of the modernization and development of the world economy, there is no alternative to environmentally friendly infrastructure and working environment for pioneering and sustainable industrialization in parallel with the Sustainable Development Goals. The temperature of the earth has increased much more than what it was before the industrial age. If this trend continues, the temperature will increase by 1.5 degrees by 2030, according to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report. In today's world everyone is aware and conscious about climate change.\n\nConsumers especially young consumers want to know about the environmental quality of the product such as carbon footprint, water footprint, ecological footprint etc. while purchasing the product. Everyone is now interested in buying and using products produced in environmentally friendly factories. In such a situation, the importance of green industrialization in our garment industry is very high. Not only the needs of the consumer group can be met by using eco-friendly technology, but also the importance of eco-friendly industry is immense in terms of branding and image building. Along with this, a precedent is being created to increase productivity. For this reason, the importance of environment-friendly technology and sustainable green industrialization should be increased not only in the ready-made garment industry, but also in other areas to increase exports.\n\nRifat Rafique Badhan is a\n\nfreelancer and a columnist.",

    "title": "‘Economy first’ Mirza Fakhrul flags tough road ahead for next govt",
    "body": "Fresh from the euphoria of a landslide electoral victory, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir struck a sober note on Friday, warning that reviving the economy will be the foremost challenge for the incoming government. Speaking to journalists outside the domestic terminal of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport after returning from his constituency in Thakurgaon, Fakhrul outlined what he described as the “real tests” awaiting the new administration.\n\n“The biggest challenge for the next government is to revive the economy,” he said. “Alongside that, we must maintain law and order, control corruption and establish justice.” His remarks come a day after the BNP secured a commanding victory in the 13th National Parliament Election, paving the way for the party to form the next government under chairman Tarique Rahman.\n\nWhile celebrating what he termed an “unprecedented victory,” Fakhrul acknowledged a personal and collective sense of loss.\n\n“This result is both joyful and sad,” he said. “It is sad that our late Chairperson Khaleda Zia could not witness this moment.” The BNP leader described the election as “wonderful, festive and transparent,” linking it to what he called the mass uprising of students and citizens that paved the way for political change.\n\n“I am personally impressed,” he added. “If we can maintain this continuity, democracy will remain protected.” When asked about the implications of an election held without the participation of the Awami League, Mirza Fakhrul refrained from direct political commentary. “The Election Commission has already taken a decision regarding the Awami League. Their activities have been banned,” he said, referring to actions taken by the Election Commission of Bangladesh.\n\n“Future decisions will come from evolving political contexts.” From the airport, Fakhrul headed straight to the BNP chairperson’s office in Gulshan, where he formally congratulated Tarique Rahman with a bouquet. Mirza Fakhrul said the BNP, having won a majority of seats in the 13th parliamentary election, will form the next government under the leadership of party Chairman Tarique Rahman.\n\nAccording to unofficial results, BNP won 209 out of 299 seats. Commenting on the election results, Mirza Fakhrul described the moment as both joyous and sad. \"One part is joy, another part is sadness. Our late chairperson and national leader, Begum Khaleda Zia, could not see this unprecedented victory, which is very sad,\" he said. He said that after the success of the student-led mass uprisings, achieved at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives, a transparent election was held in a festive mood. \"Personally, I am deeply impressed. If we can maintain this continuity, we can preserve the progress of democracy,\" the BNP leader said.\n\nWhen asked about the election held without the participation of the Awami League, Mirza Fakhrul said, \"The Election Commission has already taken decisions regarding the Awami League, and their activities have been suspended. Further decisions will depend on future political developments.\"\n\nAfter arriving in Dhaka from the airport, Fakhrul went to the BNP chairman's office in Gulshan to congratulate Tarique Rahman with flowers.\n\nParty’s standing committee members Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury and Salahuddin Ahmed, along with Chairperson’s Advisory Council member Ismail Zabihullah, were present during the exchange. The symbolic gesture underscored a transition from campaign mode to governance mode. With a decisive parliamentary majority secured, attention now shifts from ballot boxes to balance sheets. Analysts say public expectations are high, particularly regarding inflation, employment and financial stability.",

    "body": "Technical innovation has now become order of the day. It is throughout the globe; we find that technical innovation has wreathed apart all nook and corners of the society. Each and every day in our life we witness technical innovation around the globe. This is no doubt a remarkable awakening in today’s world. The fruits of success have no doubt deeply impacted upon the humanity but it should have proper utilization.\n\nIn order to delve into details, let throw deep light upon the key area. Before delve into details, let me touch upon that what actually the said term is referred to in common parlance. Thus, the said term has been referred to as such that indicates the process of creation or implementation of improved technologies, products or processes which enhance efficiency, competitiveness and value of the products. It is also helpful to sped economic growth and societal change.\n\nLot needs to be introspected about technical innovation. Especially in South Asian nations like India, Bangladesh, and other South Asian nations, technical innovation might be appreciable. But utilization should be as such, that gives an indication that in both nations there should be fullest development of the societies in both nations. With proper utilization of technical innovation, we should infer that fruits of technical development and innovation aim forward that people of all sections of societies should be accorded fullest amenities. When the technical innovation and benefits do not reach to all sections of societies in India and Bangladesh, then we evince from close quarters a friction and coercive temperament erupt which is totally detrimental. Because of the above reasons, we find discriminatory temperament arise which is not at all appreciable.\n\nNow let me examine the common advantages of technological innovation. Among all the advantages being associated, some of the common ones are stated as such, improvement of relationships with customers, innovation in international processes with customers, innovation in products and services, improvement of productivity and reduction of costs, technological innovation is beneficial for sustainable development and finally it is beneficial for creation of new employment opportunities.\n\nHereby I state various types of technical innovation, which are stated as such, disruptive innovations, incremental innovations, radical innovations and paradigm shifting innovations.\n\nNow let me examine the impact of technological innovation on economic development. Technical innovation creates an indelible impact upon economic development. Now in any major economic force of the globe, the citizens of the globe are deeply benefited by the impact of technical innovation on economic development of a nation. In countries under South Asian Sub-Continent, we find that the impact of technological innovation is deep rooted. Without technological innovation, societies around the globe will be lost in the wilderness. The impact of new innovations is very much relevant as per the demand of the economy is concerned. In any industry in India and Bangladesh we find newly wed technological innovations are dearly welcomed by the citizens. Though Bangladesh is in the midst of severe political and social turmoil. Hope things might turn out for betterment.\n\nIn India, Bangladesh plus other South Asian nations, we find that technical innovation is flourishing greatly. It is the responsibility of our governance to ensure that the fruits of development in concurrence to scientific innovation should reach out to masses of India. The same is applicable for Bangladesh. The biggest problem for is mindset for the Indian citizens. In this regard, the Great souls of India and also other parts of the globe always were and are in favor of technical and scientific innovation. This we cannot disagree from the core of our heart and mind.\n\nIf I wish to emphasize about how the humanity should adapt to technical innovation. In order to delve into my thought process, let me introspect into it. To delve into my thoughts, let me probe into it.\n\nIn an ever-changing technological landscape, humanity always have the inclination to adapt to technical innovation. There are various ways and means behind it. Which are stated as follow:\n\nCuriosity and eagerness to crave in for innovative ideas-One of the key areas is to individual’s adaptability to new ideas is through mode of technological innovation.\n\nExertion in professional life-In the professional life, it is always advisable to be adept for humanity to updated with various kinds of technical innovations.\n\nAcceptability into daily life-The most successful techno-economic and socio-economic personnel always lunge forward to new technologies in their daily routine life.\n\nEmbracing growth mindset-The world at present is transforming my leaps and bounds. That is why in order to adapt to changing scenarios around the globe, technological innovation sounds of as paramount importance. It is through the impact of technological innovation humanity across this vast nation crave in for growth mindset. The same impact should be felt in Bangladesh too.\n\nDevelopment of digital literacy-Digital literacy seems to be of prime importance. The more we are accustomed with digital literacy the more we achieve economic growth in modern competitive scenario.\n\nThere might be various other issues by which humanity is able to adapt to changing scenarios. In this shortest possible time, my objective is not to bore my respected online readers across the globe, which also includes two closer and cordial nations of South Asian Sub-Continent India and Bangladesh.\n\nIn both nations, there was a feeling that literary subjects, social science, pure science, medical science and others are dependent solely upon literature. But as days pass off, I find that the impact of technical innovation has gained profound impact which we cannot deny at all. It is due to the impact of technical innovation humanity around the globe, is able to become closer to each other mainly due to technological innovation. The impact of which is deeply felt in both India and Bangladesh.\n\nBy deducing the above views, we must admit that there should be meticulous global outreach among all citizens. It is only through the mode of technical innovation; our endeavor should bear fruit. Again, I do possess candid admittance in perspective to human adaptability to technical innovation. As the globe is advancing fast, the best way to achieve human success is through the mode of technical innovation.\n\nSujayendra Das is a columnist\n\nbased in Calcutta, India.",

    "title": "Venezuela opens up oil sector: what now?",
    "body": "In one fell swoop, decades of oil sector nationalization ended in Venezuela this week, as the global leader in known reserves opened up to private firms while seeking Washington's benediction. Parliament on Thursday approved a reform of Venezuela's Hydrocarbons Law, tightened under socialist ex-leader Hugo Chavez in 2006 to entrench state control over a resource Venezuela has more of than any other country on Earth. The move was immediately reciprocated by the US Treasury loosening an embargo in place since 2019 on Venezuelan crude, reports AFP.\n\nHow things stand:\n\nLower taxes, royalties\n\nInterim leader Delcy Rodriguez, trying to stay in US President Donald Trump's good graces after he ousted her predecessor Nicolas Maduro, has agreed to grant access to Venezuelan oil. A Maduro ally who served as his vice president, she has retained the hydrocarbons portfolio she has held for years. Venezuela's oil sector grew by 16 percent under Rodriguez's direction in 2025, and private sector projections point to growth of 30 percent this year.\n\nThe reform approved Thursday offers greater guarantees to private players, relinquishes state control of exploration, and lowers taxes.\n\nIt authorizes private firms to exploit, distribute, and market oil without state participation, and to transfer assets to other private entities. The state can reduce royalties for bigger projects, and cut taxes at its discretion. \"This obviously completely dismantles Hugo Chavez's oil model,\" said Francisco Monaldi, an energy policy expert at Rice University in Texas, while pointing out the state will retain some discretion over the issuing of contracts to private players. The reform also seeks to boost investor confidence by allowing for international arbitration in disputes.\n\nConditions\n\nThe United States on Thursday issued General License 46, easing sanctions and authorizing American companies to export, sell, store, market, transport, and refine Venezuelan crude. It stipulates that contracts with the Venezuelan government, state oil company PDVSA or subsidiaries must be governed by US law. It sets a number of conditions: payments via debt swaps, in gold, or in digital assets such as crypto currencies issued by Venezuela are not permitted. Transactions with persons or entities linked to Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and China are also banned.\n\nWait and see\n\nUS firms ExxonMobil and Chevron said Friday that they were awaiting signs of greater fiscal and legal stability in Venezuela before making any big decisions. ExxonMobil has not operated in Venezuela since its assets were expropriated in 2007, while Chevron has remained in the country under a special license.\n\nIf all conditions are met, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said Friday Venezuela \"has the opportunity to become a more sizable part of our portfolio in the future.\" Chevron estimates its production will rise from 50,000 to 250,000 barrels per day in two years. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, for his part, said institutional and economic stability were \"significant challenges that must be addressed\" and the company would watch for a transition \"to a representative government.\" Oil expert Oswaldo Felizzola said it was \"unclear\" whether other oil companies such as Spain's Repsol or Italy's ENI could operate under General License 46.\n\nChevron model\n\nAnalysts expect the US to loosen sanctions even further, allowing companies to operate under the so-called Chevron model -- acting as a minority shareholder in ventures with PDVSA. \"It's the only way to obtain significant investment for the country\", Venezuela's former oil deputy minister Dolores Dobarro said. \"This license is good...because it has no expiration term, and that gives companies a great deal of security.\"\n\nCash flow boost\n\nAnalysts take it for granted that there will be a rise in oil exports and revenues for Venezuela, which under sanctions was obliged to sell its crude on the black market below market value, transported under the radar on so-called \"ghost\" ships. The government expects an 18 percent increase this year in oil production -- which closed 2025 at 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nFelizzola forecast a rise of 34 percent to 1.5 million bpd, while Monaldi projected 1.4 million bpd over a longer period, given the large investment required in infrastructure. The change will have \"a direct impact on the sector's cash flow by reducing the discounts applied to crude, as well as operating and transportation costs,\" said Caracas-based economist Asdrubal Oliveros.\n\nIt was too early to tell, he added, whether this would result in a better quality of life in a petro state rife with economic problems.",

    "title": "‘Interim govt dismantles power sector corruption’",
    "body": "The interim government has dismantled the entrenched institutional framework of corruption in the power and energy sector and taken steps to establish a more transparent and accountable system, said Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan. Speaking at a press conference at the Power Division headquarters on Tuesday, the adviser said corruption in the sector had not been limited to individuals but had been embedded in legal and administrative structures built up over many years.\n\n“Our first task was to dismantle that architecture,” he said. Fouzul Kabir Khan unveiled Energy for Change, a publication by the Forum for Energy Reporters Bangladesh (FERB). He said the interim administration repealed the controversial special law enacted in 2010, which had enabled irregularities in the sector. Authority to set electricity and energy prices has since been restored to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), reversing a system that concentrated pricing power in government hands.\n\n“As a result, electricity prices have not increased over the past 17 months,” he said. The adviser also highlighted measures to address conflicts of interest. Previously, secretaries of relevant ministries served as chairpersons of companies under their own divisions, a practice that has now been fully discontinued. He said the government has formulated the Renewable Energy Policy 2025 and the Merchant Power Policy 2025. A new regulation has also been drafted to restore balance of authority between the Rural Electrification Board and rural electricity cooperatives and is currently under legislative review.\n\nTo identify corruption, two committees examined systemic and project-level irregularities. Their findings have been preserved for the next elected government to take action where necessary.\n\nFouzul Kabir said a new Energy and Power Sector Master Plan has been prepared, along with documentation of cost-saving measures. He added that he would leave behind a written “statement for successor” outlining the sector’s status, actions taken and future priorities.\n\nHe said rooftop solar systems have been installed at government offices and net-metering policies implemented. Solar projects are now being awarded strictly through open tenders. He also claimed significant savings in fuel imports. Clearing overdue foreign payments reduced late fees and premiums, increased competition in oil and LNG imports, lowered average premiums by around 35% and saved about Tk1,500 crore within six months.\n\nThe adviser said the modernisation project of the Eastern Refinery has been brought under regular procurement rules, though uncertainty over the interim government’s tenure has discouraged major foreign investment. He said preliminary steps have been taken to advance gas exploration and urged patience, saying lasting reforms would require a stable, full-term government.",

    "title": "Trade agreement with US to boost export, FDI: S.k Bashir",
    "body": "Commerce Adviser S.k Bashir Uddin said that the signing of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade (ART) with the US on Monday will boost exports significantly and attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) to Bangladesh.\n\n“Around 85% to 86% of Bangladeshi products exported to the US will enjoy zero-duty benefits following the signing of the ART between the two countries. And the remaining 14%-15% will face a supplementary duty of 19%,” the adviser said at a press conference at the ministry’s conference room in the capital.\n\n“Around 86% of Bangladesh’s total exports consist of readymade garments (RMG). If Bangladeshi garments are manufactured using US cotton, those products will receive zero supplementary duty access to the US market,” he explained.\n\nThe adviser said the US consumes approximately $340 billion worth of apparel annually. Bangladesh is the only country that has secured zero-duty benefits in this way.\n\nOn 2 April 2025, US President Donald Trump announced the imposition of higher tariffs on more than 100 countries. Bangladesh initially faced an additional 37% tariff, which was later reduced to 20% following negotiations and took effect on 1 August that year.\n\nBashir said, “The government made dedicated efforts to ensure continued market access. In the first phase, we succeeded in reducing the additional tariff rate from 37% to 20%. Finally, the tariff has been reduced from 20% to 19%.”\n\n“Bangladesh worked on several structural reforms and import liberalisation measures to reduce the trade deficit, which exceeds $6 billion,” he added.\n\nBashir noted that Bangladesh is one of the world’s largest cotton importers, as only about 2% of the cotton required for garment production is produced domestically, while the remaining 98% must be imported. The US cotton is very suitable for Bangladesh and will help reduce the trade deficit.\n\nHe also mentioned plans to reduce the trade deficit by increasing imports from the US, including agricultural products, energy products, and traditional metal scrap. The adviser said that in addition to garments, several other products—such as pharmaceuticals, boards, plywood, and furniture components—will also enjoy zero-duty access.\n\nHe said Bangladesh already imports many of the agricultural products included in the agreement. Referring to previous claims of food self-sufficiency, the adviser said, “The idea that Bangladesh is food self-sufficient has proven to be incorrect, as we still import wheat, maize, oilseeds, and various agricultural products worth $15 billion.”\n\nFDI will boost\n\nThe adviser added that exporters from other countries who face tariffs may now choose to invest in Bangladesh. “If we can import cotton, produce yarn, and export garments, foreign investment will increase. Not only the garment sector, but also the textile spinning and weaving sectors will benefit significantly through a two-stage transformation process,” he said.\n\nAt the press conference, Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman said that alongside the ART, the US has granted a tariff facility titled “Potential Tariff Adjustment for Partner Countries,” effective from the date the agreement comes into force. Under this facility, duty-free benefits have been extended to more than 2,500 items. “Pharmaceuticals rank at the top of the list.\n\nAll HS codes and raw materials related to pharmaceuticals have been granted duty-free benefits. Other products include plastic goods, aircraft components, and plywood boards. The facility applies to countries that have entered into agreements with the US,” he added.",

    "body": "Bangladesh’s readymade garment (RMG) exports declined by 2.43 percent year-on-year to US$22.98 billion during July–January of fiscal year 2025–26, according to the latest country-wise export data published by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). The European Union (EU) remained the country’s largest export destination for RMG, accounting for 49.35 percent of total exports in the category. Export earnings from the EU stood at US$11.34 billion, marking a 3.98 percent year-on-year decline, said former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel on Monday, reports UNB.\n\nThe United States retained its position as the second-largest market. RMG exports to the USA amounted to US$4.47 billion, representing 19.46 percent of total RMG exports, with a marginal year-on-year decrease of 0.03 percent. According to EPB data, Bangladesh’s total RMG exports to the United States from February 2025 to January 2026 reached US$7,544.34 million. During this period, total national RMG exports stood at US$38,775.15 million, with the US market accounting for 19.46 percent of the total.\n\nExports to Canada and the United Kingdom posted positive growth during the period. RMG exports to Canada amounted to US$784.17 million, accounting for a 3.41 percent share and showing 4.42 percent year-on-year growth. Exports to the United Kingdom reached US$2.62 billion, representing an 11.38 percent share with 2.55 percent growth. Exports to non-traditional markets stood at US$3.77 billion, accounting for 16.40 percent of total RMG exports, though registering a 4.99 percent year-on-year decline.

    "title": "From Protection to Precision: India’s New FTA Strategy",
    "body": "”India’s recent free trade agreements (FTAs) reflect a strategic shift from defensive trade policy toward a targeted, growth-driven approach. Rather than pursuing agreements for geopolitical signaling or aspirational market access, India has focused on partners where trade complementarities are already strong, logistics are efficient, and economic interests are aligned. ”\n\nThe results are clear: between FY 2020–21 and FY 2024–25, India’s merchandise trade with strategic FTA partners grew by 92%, compared with 41.5% growth in India’s total merchandise trade with the world. This marks a decisive departure from earlier trade strategies. India is increasingly choosing partners where bilateral trade was already expanding and where agreements can amplify existing momentum rather than attempting to create new trade relationships from scratch. FTAs are thus being used to consolidate and accelerate trade corridors that already demonstrate strong potential.\n\nBetween FY 2020–21 and FY 2024–25, India’s total trade with countries covered by FTAs signed since 2021 rose by 92%, far outpacing the 41.5% growth in India’s global trade. The share of these partners in India’s overall trade basket increased from roughly 11–12% in FY 2021 to nearly 16.5% by FY 2025. This shift reflects a deliberate strategy of prioritizing high-intensity, bilateral, trade-oriented economies aligned with India’s strengths in manufacturing, energy processing, pharmaceuticals, services, and investment-led growth.\n\nImportantly, much of this acceleration predates the formal entry into force of FTAs signed in 2024 and 2025. This underscores a key insight: India’s recent FTAs validate existing trade complementarities rather than create them. They serve to lock in, de-risk, and scale trade corridors that proved resilient during the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nRecent FTAs and What Makes Them Work:\n\nAustralia: Resources Meet Manufacturing and Medicines\n\nIndia signed an FTA with Australia in 2022. Since then, bilateral trade has grown rapidly, increasing by 96% between FY 2020–21 and FY 2024–25. Australia supplies coal, critical minerals, metal ores, and energy inputs central to India’s industrial base, while India exports refined petroleum products, pharmaceuticals, machinery, textiles, and consumer goods. The agreement also strengthens services links, particularly in education and professional services, and supports cooperation in clean energy and critical minerals. Strategically, Australia helps India diversify supply chains and secure key resource inputs for long-term growth.\n\nNew Zealand: Small Base, Clear Complementarities\n\nIndia signed an FTA with New Zealand in 2025. Trade has risen by about 50% from a small base, reflecting niche but clear complementarities. India exports pharmaceuticals, machinery, and manufactured goods, while importing wool, agricultural products, metals, and raw materials. The agreement is carefully calibrated, balancing market access with domestic sensitivities, particularly in agriculture, and includes an investment dimension that signals confidence in India’s medium-term growth prospects.\n\nUnited Kingdom: A High-Value, Services-Rich Partnership\n\nIndia signed an FTA with the UK in 2025. India–UK trade expanded by 76% between FY 2021 and FY 2025, even before the agreement’s formal conclusion. The UK is a high-income, high-standards market where India competes strongly in pharmaceuticals, textiles, engineering goods, chemicals, auto components, and services. The agreement improves market access, addresses barriers in services and professional mobility, and strengthens investment ties in technology, finance, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy. It reflects India’s confidence in engaging developed markets without undermining domestic policy space.\n\nEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA): Trade Plus Investment, Not Tariffs Alone\n\nIndia signed a trade deal with EFTA countries in 2024 . Merchandise trade growth of around 19% understates the agreement’s significance. Imports from EFTA are concentrated in high-value items such as gold, precision instruments, and chemicals, keeping trade volumes stable. The real value lies in embedded investment commitments, technology collaboration, and high-skill job creation. The India–EFTA pact marks a shift from viewing FTAs purely as tariff instruments to using them as vehicles for capital formation and industrial upgrading.\n\nMauritius: Small Trade Volumes, Large Strategic Value\n\nThe India–Mauritius Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement functions primarily as a gateway agreement. Anchored in services, investment facilitation, and financial cooperation, it formalises an already close economic relationship. While merchandise trade has grown by about 13% between FY 2021 and FY 2025, the agreement’s importance lies in strengthening regulatory cooperation and institutional “plumbing” for cross-border investment and services.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: The Flagship of India’s FTA Strategy\n\nIndia signed an FTA with the UAE in 2022. Bilateral trade surged from US$43 billion in FY 2021 to over US$100 billion by FY 2025, a 131% expansion in four years. India exports petroleum products, gems and jewelry, machinery, food products, textiles, and manufactured goods, while importing crude oil, petrochemicals, precious metals, and intermediates. The UAE’s role as a global logistics hub amplifies these flows, while strong services and investment linkages reinforce the partnership. This agreement demonstrates how trade intensity, logistics efficiency, and sectoral alignment can deliver scale and resilience.\n\nOman: Energy, Logistics, and Proximity\n\nIndia signed an FTA with Oman in 2025, with bilateral trade rising by 95% over four years. The relationship is anchored in energy imports, food products, machinery, metals, and logistics services. Geographic proximity and historical commercial ties give this corridor inherent strength, and the comprehensive nature of the agreement consolidates a trade trajectory that was already moving decisively upward.\n\nConclusion: FTAs as Accelerators, Not Experiments\n\nIndia’s recent FTAs are not speculative exercises. They are anchored in trade corridors that were already expanding rapidly during the post-COVID recovery. The 92% growth in trade with these partners—more than double India’s global trade growth—shows that India is signing agreements where complementarities are real, logistics are efficient, and economic interests are aligned.\n\nAs tariff commitments deepen, services provisions mature, and investment pipelines translate into capacity creation, India’s trade with FTAs signed since 2021 is expected to more than double again by 2030. In a fragmented global trade environment, India’s strategy of signing FTAs where trade already flourishes may prove to be its most resilient and economically sound breakthrough.\n\nWritten by: Anna Mahjar-Barducci (The author is a Project Director at the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).

    "title": "De-Risking Done Right: EU Eyes ‘Mother of All Deals’ with India",
    "body": "In her address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the impending EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) as the “mother of all deals.” She stated: “We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP.” This characterization reflects the agreement’s scale: combining the European Union’s population of approximately 450 million with India’s 1.44 billion would form one of the world’s largest integrated markets, representing roughly 24-25% of global GDP based on current IMF projections (EU ~$20 trillion nominal GDP; India ~$4-4.5 trillion in 2025-26 estimates).\n\nNegotiations, relaunched in 2022 after stalling in 2013, have accelerated amid geopolitical shifts, including U.S. tariff uncertainties under evolving policies. As of January 2026, multiple sources, including Reuters, BBC, and official statements, indicate the deal is nearing conclusion. An announcement of concluded negotiations is expected imminently, potentially formalized at the India-EU summit in New Delhi around January 27, 2026. The pact encompasses tariff reductions on goods, services liberalization, investment protection, geographical indications, public procurement access, and enforceable sustainability chapters on labor, environment, and climate.\n\nBaseline Trade Data: Current EU-India Economic Interdependence\n\nThe EU stands as India’s largest trading partner bloc, while India ranks as the EU’s 9th largest overall. Bilateral merchandise trade reached €120 billion (~$140 billion) in 2024, per European Commission data, equivalent to 11.5% of India’s total external trade. Indian fiscal year 2024-25 figures show bilateral goods trade at approximately $136-136.53 billion, with India’s exports to the EU at $75.85-76 billion and imports from the EU at $59-60.68 billion (sources: Ministry of Commerce India, PIB, Reuters).\n\nKey Indian exports to the EU include:\n\n*Textiles and garments (facing average tariffs of up to 12% in some categories)\n\n*Chemicals and pharmaceuticals\n\n*Machinery, appliances, and base metals\n\n*Jewelry and leather products\n\n*EU exports to India dominate in:\n\nMachinery and transport equipment (including automobiles and aircraft)\n\n*Chemicals and pharmaceuticals\n\n*Optical and precision instruments\n\n*Services trade has grown rapidly, totaling over €66 billion in 2024 (EU imports ~€37 billion, exports ~€29 billion), more than double the €30.4 billion in 2020. A significant portion involves IT, business process outsourcing, and financial services, where India holds a surplus.\n\nOver the past decade, goods trade has expanded by nearly 90%, while services have more than doubled, underscoring untapped potential constrained by average applied tariffs (EU on Indian goods ~3.8% overall, but higher in labor-intensive sectors; Indian tariffs on EU goods often 10-20%+ in automobiles, wines, and machinery).\n\nProjected Economic Impacts: Quantitative Estimates\n\nIndependent studies and post-negotiation projections highlight substantial gains. A 2020 European Parliament-commissioned study (updated scenarios) estimated that a comprehensive FTA could boost EU exports to India by 20-60% in optimistic models, with merchandise exports potentially reaching €112.5 billion by 2032 (a 107.6% increase from baseline levels, per International Economics Consulting analysis). Indian exports to the EU could see similar proportional gains, particularly in value-added sectors.\n\nBilateral merchandise trade is forecasted to climb toward $250 billion by 2030-31 in optimistic scenarios, from the current ~$136 billion. Combined goods and services trade could exceed $300 billion annually within a decade post-implementation.\n\nMacro-level effects include:\n\n*GDP uplift: CGE models (e.g., from pre-2022 assessments) suggest India’s GDP could rise by 0.3-1% cumulatively over 10 years due to enhanced export competitiveness, technology transfer, and FDI inflows. For the EU, gains are estimated at 0.1-0.5% GDP, driven by market access in a high-growth economy (India’s average annual growth ~6-7% per IMF).\n\n*Employment: In India, labor-intensive sectors like textiles, apparel, jewelry, and pharmaceuticals could generate millions of jobs. Projections indicate export-led manufacturing growth could add 1-2 million direct jobs in these areas, with multiplier effects in supply chains. For the EU, automotive, machinery, and services sectors could see employment stabilization or modest gains through expanded exports.\n\n*FDI flows: The investment protection chapter (including ISDS mechanisms) is expected to boost EU FDI into India, which stood at ~€100 billion cumulative stock pre-2025. Reduced risks could accelerate inflows into green energy, digital infrastructure, and manufacturing.\n\nSector-specific data:\n\n*Automobiles: EU firms (e.g., German manufacturers) face 60-100%+ Indian tariffs; reductions could increase EU car exports significantly, while Indian auto parts gain tariff-free access.\n\n*Textiles/Apparel: Indian exports (~€10-15 billion annually to EU) face peak tariffs; elimination could restore competitiveness lost from GSP+ graduations.\n\n*Pharmaceuticals: India supplies ~20-25% of EU generics; streamlined regulations and IP provisions could expand this.\n\n*Services: Mode 4 (movement of professionals) liberalization could boost Indian IT/BPO exports by 30-50% in targeted models.\n\nStrategic and Geopolitical Dimensions\n\nBeyond pure economics, the FTA aligns with de-risking strategies. The EU seeks diversification from over-reliance on certain Asian suppliers, while India pursues “China+1” manufacturing shifts and reduced dependence on single markets. In a fragmented global trade environment, with potential U.S. tariff escalations, the deal provides resilience. It covers sustainable development with binding commitments, supporting EU Green Deal goals (e.g., carbon border adjustments) and India’s net-zero ambitions by 2070.\n\nChallenges remain: India seeks safeguards for agriculture (dairy, poultry) and sensitive sectors, while the EU prioritizes strong IP enforcement and labor standards. Balanced outcomes are emphasized in recent rounds.\n\nIn quantitative terms, the agreement could elevate bilateral ties from a €120-140 billion goods/services baseline to a multi-hundred-billion-dollar partnership, fostering supply chain integration in strategic sectors like semiconductors, renewables, and digital tech.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen’s “mother of all deals” framing captures this transformative potential: not merely incremental trade growth, but a strategic economic bridge between two major democracies representing nearly a quarter of humanity and global output. As negotiations conclude in early 2026, implementation will test whether these projections materialize, delivering mutual prosperity in an uncertain world.\n\nWritten by: Elias Badeaux (The author is a student of International Development Studies International Development Studies at the University of Clermont Auvergne, UCA in France.

    "title": "New Zealand-India FTA: A Southern Anchor of Stability that goes beyond Trade",
    "body": "The global order in 2026 is largely unpredictable. Against this backdrop of increasing geoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical risks, the conclusion of the India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in December 2025 has substantive economic and strategic significance that is much bigger than a trade deal. It represents a pivot for New Zealand toward deeper engagement with the world’s most populous nation and fastest-growing economy in the world. From India’s perspective, this agreement builds on its “Act East” and “Indo-Pacific” pillars of its foreign trade policy, aiming to secure a trusted, long-term, comprehensive economic partnership in a region increasingly shaped by competing spheres of influence. It provides an important framework for leveraging the complementarities between the two countries, with India providing scale and workforce, and New Zealand providing technology and capital.\n\nThe conclusion of this trade deal after just nine months of high-speed negotiations sent a clear message that pragmatism has prevailed and that both sides have agreed on a framework for a bilateral economic partnership for the mid-21st century — one that prioritises a $20 billion investment pipeline, high-tech agricultural collaboration focused on supply chain resilience, and a radical new pathway to access skilled human capital. The comprehensive New Zealand-India FTA is therefore not just about trade; it is about building a “Southern Anchor” of stability in a volatile Indo-Pacific through strategic economic engagement.\n\nStrategic Realism, Supply Chain Resilience and Talent Security\n\nThe foundations for this are already evident in the key provisions agreed in this FTA. First, while sceptics in New Zealand argue that without full, zero-duty access for milk powder and butter, the FTA is a “hollow” victory for its primary sector, this agreement brings strategic realism, providing a win-win for agribusinesses in both countries. This is evident in the fact that, through this FTA, New Zealand is delivering innovative Agriculture Productivity Action Plans for kiwifruit, apples, and honey to improve productivity, quality, and sectoral capabilities in India, through cooperation involving the establishment of Centres of Excellence, improved planting material, capacity building for growers, collaborative research, and technical support for orchard management, post-harvest practices, supply chain performance, and food safety. Furthermore, this deal secures “Action Plans” for high-value niches (like functional milk proteins and infant nutrition products), combining India’s demand for high-value dairy with NZ’s world-leading agricultural technology and genetics. That way, New Zealand becomes a partner in India’s dairy supply chain, not only improving India’s productivity but also selling worldwide from India as an export base for its high-value dairy ingredients. The strategic realism lies in the fact that this FTA allows market access for selected agricultural products (apples, kiwifruit, Manuka honey) and albumins from New Zealand to be managed through a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) system linked to delivery on the above-mentioned agricultural productivity action plans.\n\nSecond, while there’s scepticism about the feasibility of the $20 billion NZ investment commitment over 15 years, given NZ’s relatively small capital markets, this isn’t government spending. This will involve the NZ private equity and businesses tapping into India’s large consumer base, infrastructure, green energy, and digital ambitions as part of its Vision 2047.\n\nThird, this FTA allows mobility in the special skills category and can be seen as a “talent security” move for New Zealand. With its economy projected to face a shortfall of nearly 250,000 workers by 2045, the agreement addresses a critical structural bottleneck: the talent gap. The scepticism that the 5,000 temporary visa quotas for Indian professionals will suppress local wages or strain housing overlooks the fact that these will be non-renewable visas valid for only 3 years. Given that in 2026 the global war for talent will be fierce, New Zealand needs engineers, healthcare workers, and IT specialists to relieve supply-side bottlenecks and maintain its own standard of living. Unlike generic immigration pathways, the visa quotas in this FTA are specifically designed to feed New Zealand’s high-growth sectors, such as the Tech Ecosystem. For the Silicon Wellington and Auckland corridors, the guaranteed access for Indian IT and AI engineers provides the scale needed to compete globally. This also streamlines entry for healthcare professionals and educators, easing pressure on our core social infrastructure. Uniquely, the FTA opens doors for yoga instructors, chefs, and music teachers, enriching New Zealand’s cultural fabric and wellness industry. These provisions in the services sector give the sector an advantage in attracting India’s top-tier professionals, while the “Work and Holiday” visas help address chronic seasonal labour shortages in New Zealand regions. Clearly, the true economic value of this agreement goes beyond farms and factories to nurturing and recognising talent in a knowledge-based 21st-century economy.\n\nThe Geopolitical Context: Stability in a “Rewired” World\n\nAs we navigate 2026, the global operating environment is increasingly defined by three forces: technological sovereignty, the geopolitics of scarcity, and the rise of “Spheres of Engagement.” Against the backdrop of an aggressive US trade agenda and the continued restructuring of supply chains away from over-dependence on single markets, the India-NZ FTA serves as a\n\nlesson in dealing with Middle Power resilience. The deal is a vital component of the broader Indo-Pacific maritime security architecture, complementing India’s existing pacts with Australia and the UAE to form a “Southern Anchor” of democratic trade. The FTA includes specific provisions for port services cooperation and logistics efficiency. As an example, by streamlining the sea lanes between the Port of Auckland and Mumbai/Chennai, the two countries would aim to insulate themselves against the “maritime turbulence” currently affecting the South China Sea and traditional Pacific routes, turning New Zealand into India’s economic gateway to the wider Oceania and Pacific Island Countries (PICs). A salient feature in this agreement geopolitically is that this deal moves the economic relationship from a transactional “buy-sell” dynamics to one of shared economic prosperity, partnering for the long-term, thereby building in a trust premium that’s essential in an unpredictable and high-risk-based global environment.\n\nCall to Action\n\nThe signing of the India-NZ FTA marks the beginning of a new era and a call to action. For this agreement to fulfil its long-term objectives, the focus must now shift from the diplomats in Wellington and New Delhi to the boardrooms and to academic brainstorming and research involving both nations through partnerships. A key step towards this should be a dedicated think tank aimed at a deeper and better understanding of New Zealand-India economic relations over the longer term, ensuring that outcomes meet the ambitions outlined in this agreement.\n\nAs the FTA is signed and implemented in late 2026, New Zealand businesses need to recognise that it allows for future consultations to add more value for both countries. Opportunities in agri-tech, wine, and high-value horticulture are already wide open, but they require localised branding and long-term relationship-building to succeed in the Indian market, especially at the state level. Second, the government must ensure that the professional mobility quotas are integrated with industry needs immediately, preventing the “talent-matching” friction that often plagues trade deals. Last, but not least, direct air connectivity between the two countries should be established as soon as possible to lower bilateral trade and logistics costs and better utilise the opportunities offered by this FTA.\n\nIn a world of geopolitical uncertainty, India has secured a “Southern Anchor” through this FTA, but an anchor only provides stability if the ship is ready to sail. It is time for New Zealand’s exporters, investors, and innovators to seize this 21st-century pivot. The blueprint for a resilient, diversified, and high-tech partnership is ready; the challenge now is for both sides to build it for shared economic prosperity.\n\nWritten by: Rahul Sen and Sadhana Srivastava (The authors are from AUT University, Auckland, New Zealand and Infinite Sum Modeling (ISM) Inc USA.

    "title": "Uzbekistan eyes fresh Japanese investments ahead of Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s Tokyo visit",
    "body": "Central Asia is shaping up to be a hotbed of interest, with major global players looking to get their foot in the door and bolster their economic and political clout in the area. Japan, along with its partners, is pulling out all the stops to broaden its horizons, steadily keeping the lines of communication open with Central Asian countries. In the grand scheme of things, Uzbekistan holds a pivotal role in this conversation, having in recent years consolidated its status as one of the region’s key centers of economic growth.\n\nLarge-scale reforms, economic liberalization, and improvements in the investment climate have made Uzbekistan an attractive platform for long-term projects. For Japan, which traditionally prioritizes stable and predictable partnerships, these factors have laid the groundwork for strengthening ties with Tashkent.\n\nEconomic ties between Uzbekistan and Japan demonstrate steady positive momentum. In 2024, trade turnover between the two countries increased by 35%, reflecting the expansion of business contacts and growing interest of Japanese companies in the Uzbek market. At the same time, investment cooperation is also strengthening, with the total portfolio of projects involving Japanese companies and financial institutions exceeding $12 billion.\n\nAround 100 joint ventures and organizations with Japanese participation operate in Uzbekistan, covering energy, mechanical engineering, the chemical industry, logistics, and infrastructure. Active investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, Marubeni, Sojitz, Toyota Tsusho, and Hitachi. These indicators form a solid economic foundation for the Uzbek-Japanese partnership and create conditions for its further expansion.\n\nIn light of this, the energy sector stands tall as the bedrock of bilateral cooperation and has been the linchpin for decades. Japan is among the few countries that, from the early years of Uzbekistan’s independence, consistently supported the modernization of the energy infrastructure through participation in the construction and upgrading of thermal power plants, the introduction of energy-efficient technologies, and modern solutions for power system management.\n\nThe notable collaborative projects include the construction of the 900-MW Turakurgan thermal power plant in the Namangan Region and the installation of the third combined-cycle unit at the Navoi thermal power plant, which has a capacity of 650 MW, in partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Power. The rollout of these projects has really turned the tide on energy supply reliability and fine-tuned fuel consumption to boot and reduced specific greenhouse gas emissions. The combined output of the new power units exceeds 10 billion kWh per year, which is of key importance for the sustainable functioning of the country’s economy.\n\nAt this juncture, the collaboration between the two nations in the energy arena is steadily pivoting towards renewable energy sources, aligning with Uzbekistan’s national priorities and the worldwide climate playbook. One of the largest projects in this area is the construction of solar power plants with a total capacity of 1,000 MW in the Samarkand and Bukhara regions, along with energy storage systems with a combined capacity of 1,336 MWh.\n\nThe project is being implemented with the participation of Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation, Chubu Electric Power, and Shikoku Electric Power, in partnership with Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power, and is one of the largest renewable energy projects in Central Asia. Its significance goes beyond individual power capacities. For Uzbekistan, it means accelerated diversification of the energy mix and reduced dependence on gas-fired generation amid growing domestic demand. For Japan, it represents the consolidation of long-term economic presence in a key regional economy and the promotion of its own technologies and financial instruments.\n\nA key role in the project’s implementation is played by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), which is providing a $635 million loan and acts as the largest financing participant. Total investment is estimated at $1.45 billion. JBIC’s participation is of fundamental importance, as the bank serves as an anchor institution, reducing risks for private investors and creating conditions for attracting commercial banks and insurance mechanisms, including support from the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI).\n\nThe collaborative framework between Uzbekistan and JBIC exhibits a systemic character. In 2024, the sides signed a three-year cooperation program that provides for the possibility of non-sovereign financing of projects by Japanese companies in the country. This mechanism is seen in Tashkent as a golden ticket for reeling in fresh Japanese investments, especially in the realms of energy, industry, and infrastructure.\n\nIn conjunction with the energy sector, the industrial domain continues to represent a pivotal facet of the collaborative framework between Uzbekistan and Japan. Japanese companies are not just putting all their eggs in one basket with equipment supplies; they’re also rolling up their sleeves to localize production, pass the baton on technology transfer, and give their industrial facilities a much-needed facelift. This approach is in line with Uzbekistan’s course toward industrialization and the development of high value-added products.\n\nIn this context, the official visit of President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Japan on December 18–20 and his participation in the first summit of heads of state of the “Central Asia + Japan” Dialogue in Tokyo are seen as a logical political consolidation of the already established economic and investment partnership. Uzbekistan is hoping that this visit will open the floodgates for Japanese investments and bolster the backbone of institutional support for collaborative projects.\n\nConsequently, the bilateral engagement between Uzbekistan and Japan is evolving into a robust partnership paradigm anchored in economic collaboration, energy sector synergies, and industrial advancements. For Uzbekistan, this opens the door to long-term capital and cutting-edge technologies, while for Japan, it’s a golden opportunity to solidify its foothold in Central Asia through one of the region’s most rapidly blossoming economies.

    "body": "Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday that newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs) will be sworn in at 10 AM on Tuesday, with the new cabinet scheduled to take oath later in the day at 4 PM on South Plaza of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban.Speaking to reporters at the ministry, Nazrul said the oath of MPs would “most probably — I repeat, most probably — under the current circumstances” be administered by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC).Quoting BNP party sources, he said that immediately after taking oath, the MPs would elect their leader of the parliamentary team at the same venue. The process is expected to take place between 11:30 AM and 12 PM.The cabinet members will be sworn in at 4 PM at South Plaza of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. “As far as I know, the President is scheduled to administer the oath,” Nazrul said.Explaining the choice of venue, the law adviser said the idea of holding the ceremony at South Plaza was initially proposed by BNP, citing the historical and symbolic significance of the location following July mass uprising.“My understanding is that this parliament is somewhat different. We attained this parliament through the sacrifices of students and the masses in July, through a mass uprising marked by immense sacrifice, hardship, pain and loss of lives. That is why this parliament is a little different from all others,” he said at the Secretariat.He noted that several historic events, including July Declaration and July Charter, were held within the parliament complex, adding that South Plaza had become especially memorable.“The funeral prayer of our late leader Begum Khaleda Zia was held at a nearby place as was the funeral of our beloved martyr Osman Hadi,” Nazrul said, adding that the plaza also emerged as a venue for documenting various aspects of July uprising.“Considering all these factors, they perhaps expressed this intention and we arranged it accordingly,” he added.Nazrul said a farewell meeting was held earlier in the day where no major decisions were taken. “We reflected on our work, shared experiences and informed everyone about the oath programme. It was more like a final meeting together,” he said.Regarding invitations to the cabinet ceremony, he said those customarily invited under convention would receive invitations and that Cabinet Division is handling the matter.On whether the Indian prime minister would attend, Nazrul said he had no such information.“What I have heard so far is that Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed the foreign ministers of SAARC countries. I have no information about any prime minister attending,” he said.Dismissing speculation about his possible inclusion in the next cabinet, Nazrul said, “There is no question at all.”SH",

    "body": "The message from Dhaka reached Indian officials late on Saturday (February 14) night, just hours after top leaders of Tarique's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) suggested that regional heads would be invited to attend the ceremony.\n\nIt is unlikely that PM Modi will go to Dhaka since he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting in Mumbai with French President Emmanuel Macron on February 17, report Hindustan Times.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Tarique Rahman as Bangladesh’s new prime minister, along with other regional leaders on February 17.Macron is visiting India to participate in the AI Impact Summit next week. The summit is being described as the largest edition to date and will be the fourth annual global gathering focused on assessing the risks and opportunities linked to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.India is expected to send a senior representative to Tarique Rahman’s inauguration, possibly the vice president or the external affairs minister, the people said the HT, adding that New Delhi also does not want to appear as moving too quickly towards renewed ties with Bangladesh, even though improving relations that had dropped to a fresh low remains important.“There is also the optics of sharing a stage with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who is also expected to be invited to the event,” one person told HT.Bangladesh is reported to be planning invitations for leaders from most member nations of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which was founded by Tarique Rahman’s father, former president Ziaur Rahman, as well as heads of state or government from other friendly countries such as China, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.",

He said ensuring a fair and positive electoral environment by convincing voters was the most challenging part of the campaign. “Bringing the people to our side and earning their confidence was our strategy. Alhamdulillah, we were successful,” he added.\n\n“Any meaningful goal requires effort,” he said, adding that achieving public confidence through democratic means was inherently difficult but necessary.\n\nForeign Policy and Regional Relations Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairman Tarique Rahman on Saturday said winning public trust and convincing people to cast their votes on his party's favor was the BNP’s only form of “engineering” in 13th parliamentary elections, stressing that the party succeeded by persuading people rather than manipulating the process.Tarique Rahman made the remarks while responding to questions at a post-election press conference at Hotel InterContinental in Dhaka, two days after the BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in the national election and moved closer to forming the next government.Responding to a question from New York-based journalist Khaled Mohiuddin of Thikana about whether his party engaged in vote engineering, the BNP chairman said, “Our engineering was convincing the people.”Tarique acknowledged that the election was not easy for the BNP. He said ensuring a fair and positive electoral environment by convincing voters was the most challenging part of the campaign. “Bringing the people to our side and earning their confidence was our strategy. Alhamdulillah, we were successful,” he added.“Any meaningful goal requires effort,” he said, adding that achieving public confidence through democratic means was inherently difficult but necessary.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging press conference, local and international journalists questioned Tarique on foreign policy, economic recovery and governance priorities.\n\nAsked about Bangladesh’s relations with India, Tarique said the BNP would shape its foreign policy strictly around protecting Bangladesh’s national interests and the interests of its people.\n\nOn how a future BNP government would balance relations with India, Pakistan and China, Tarique’s party colleague Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said foreign policy would be applied equally toward all countries, without favoring any particular state.\n\nResponding to a question from a journalist of The Independent on whether corruption cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her niece, UK MP Tulip Siddiq, would proceed, Tarique said such matters would depend on legal processes.\n\nGovernance Challenges Ahead\n\nA journalist from Al Jazeera asked what the BNP’s biggest challenges would be after forming the government. Tarique said restoring the economy, improving law and order and depoliticizing state institutions would be among the new administration’s top priorities.\n\n“The previous government politicized almost every institution,” he said. “Ensuring good governance will be a major task.”\n\nChina, BRI and Economic Policy\n\nReplying to questions from Chinese journalists, Tarique said China would remain an important development partner for Bangladesh. On the Belt and Road Initiative, he said the BNP would evaluate any involvement based on whether it served Bangladesh’s economic interests.\n\n“If it supports our economy, we will consider it. If it does not benefit the people, we will not,” he said.\n\nEconomic revival was also a key theme. Asked by the Financial Times about plans to revive a struggling economy, Tarique said a BNP government would focus on attracting investment, expanding business activity and creating new jobs.\n\nYouth, Rule of Law and SAARC\n\nOn the role of young people, Tarique said the BNP would listen to youth voices while ensuring policies reflected the needs of all segments of society, including women, older citizens and people with disabilities.\n\nAsked by Pakistan’s Geo News about reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, Tarique said Bangladesh had originally played a key role in forming SAARC and that a BNP government would seek to reactivate the forum through dialogue after taking office.\n\nOn the issue of justice for Sheikh Hasina, Tarique reiterated that it would be determined by the legal system.\n\nCommitment to Democratic Economy\n\nAddressing concerns about oligarchs and economic concentration under the previous government, Tarique said the BNP envisioned a democratic economy where businesses would operate based on merit and capability, without special privileges for select groups.\n\n“No particular group will be given undue advantage,” he said. “Everyone will have equal opportunity to do business.”",

    "title": "BNP hopeful; Jamaat active in campaign; NCP, GOP, IAB, JaPa, KM, BKA, Jamiat join race in Habiganj",
    "body": "Historically, Habiganj holds deep roots in Bangladesh's Liberation War of 1971. The district served as a key base for freedom fighters, with several battles fought near the Indian border. The historic Shaistaganj railway junction, one of the oldest in Sylhet, played a pivotal role in wartime communication and logistics. Habiganj has also produced several prominent political figures, reformers, and intellectuals who have contributed significantly to national politics and the democratic movement.\n\nWhile Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB) , Khelafat Majlis (KM), and a faction of Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam have already announced their candidates, the BNP and several other parties are still struggling to finalise their nominations.\n\nThe seat is witnessing an early surge of political activities as candidates from various parties step up their campaigns. With the national parliamentary election drawing closer, the political landscape of this seat has once again turned vibrant.\n\nSeveral parties - including the BNP, JaPa, GOP, NCP and several Islamist platforms - have begun preparations to field candidates. Discussions are already underway about potential nominees, though official confirmations are yet to be made.\n\nAdvocate Abdul Wahid Monir, Joint Convener of the Habiganj District chapter, is seeking the nomination from the NCP. Among other contenders, Chowdhury Ashraful Bari Noman, President of Habiganj District GOP, is expected to contest under his party's banner From the IAB, the likely candidate is Alhaj Mohib Uddin Ahmed Sohel, President of the party's District unit.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamiat Ulema may nominate Maulana Mahbubur Rahman Chowdhury Helal, the District unit's Joint General Secretary.\n\nParty insiders note that Advocate Aminul Islam played a pivotal role during the AL's tenure, providing legal support to countless BNP activists facing political cases. Meanwhile, former MP Shammi Akter gained widespread attention after she was reportedly assaulted by police during anti-government protests in Dhaka - footage of which circulated widely on social media.\n\nHABIGANJ, a scenic district in the Sylhet Division of north-eastern Bangladesh, is renowned for its natural beauty, tea estates, historical significance, and vibrant cultural traditions. Often referred to as the \"land of tea, hills, and rivers,\" the district has long held a special place in the nation's history and economy.Among its most defining features are the lush tea gardens that form part of Bangladesh's famed Sylhet tea belt. The rolling estates of Madhabpur and Chunarughat upazilas stretch over miles of green hills, producing a significant portion of the country's export-quality tea. These plantations - including the well-known Rashidpur, Nurjahan, and Sreemangal-adjacent estates - also sustain thousands of tea workers, many from indigenous communities. The tranquil landscapes and colonial-era tea bungalows have made the district a popular destination for both domestic and foreign tourists.Beyond its tea gardens, Habiganj is famous for its biodiversity and natural reserves. The district borders the Lawachara National Park and is home to the Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, one of the largest forest reserves in Bangladesh. Rich in flora and fauna, the sanctuary shelters rare species such as hoolock gibbons, clouded leopards, and civets, making it a haven for nature enthusiasts and researchers. Other attractions, including the Khoiyachora Waterfall, Satchari National Park, and the picturesque Madhabpur Lake, highlight the region's ecological splendour.Culturally, the district represents a fusion of Bengali and indigenous traditions. Ethnic groups such as the Manipuri, Tripuri, and Khasi communities enrich its cultural fabric through their distinct language, music, and craftsmanship. Folk performances - including baul gaan, pala gaan, and jarigan - continue to thrive in rural areas, preserving the district's centuries-old artistic identity. The presence of mosques, temples, and shrines such as the Dewan Bari Shahi Mosque in Bahubal and the Madhabkunda Temple reflect the area's deep-rooted religious harmony.Meanwhile, Habiganj has entered a new phase of political activity as Bangladesh prepares for the 13th Jatiya Sangsad election, expected in February 2026. The Election Commission (EC) has unveiled a comprehensive roadmap to ensure a fair and transparent voting process.Across Habiganj, major political parties - including Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, National Citizen Party (NCP), Jatiya Party (JaPa) and several smaller parties- are reorganising their grassroots structures. Potential candidates have begun visiting local communities, attending social events, and reviving campaign networks. Civil society organisations are also urging the EC to guarantee an inclusive and competitive election environment.HABIGANJ-1: This constituency comprises Nabiganj and Bahubal upazilas.This seat has 431,422 registered voters, including 213,544 women, 217,876 men, and 2 third-gender voters.The constituency is geographically diverse, surrounded by tea gardens, hills, and vast haor wetlands, and enriched with natural resources such as the Bibiyana and Rashidpur gas fields and the Bibiyana power plant. Another key factor in Habiganj-1 politics is the strong influence of expatriates-particularly from London. Nabiganj has the highest concentration of UK-based expatriates in Habiganj district, with an estimated one lakh residents living abroad. Their economic contributions and direct political engagement often shape the election results.The seat has emerged as one of the most politically charged battlegrounds ahead of the upcoming national election.Within the BNP, competition for the nomination is fierce. Party insiders say there are currently around 10 aspirants actively seeking nomination. These include former MP Sheikh Sujat Mia; cardiologist Dr. Khaled Mohsin, a relative of BNP acting chairperson Tarique Rahman's wife Dr. Zubaida Rahman; former mayor Sabir Ahmed Chowdhury; UK Jubo Dal's former leader Talha Chowdhury; Chicago BNP President Shah Mozammel Nantu; BNP leader Sheikh Mohiuddin; central Swechchhasebak Dal leader Mukhlisur Rahman; former UK Jubo Dal president Dewan Mukaddim Chowdhury Niaz; Nabiganj BNP President Syed Matiur Rahman Peyara, Upazila Jubo Dal Convener Moshahid Alam Murad, and former UK Jubo Dal president MA Rahim.Adding to the speculation, Dr. Reza Kibria, son of late finance minister Shah AMS Kibria, may again contest from this seat with BNP ticket. Dr. Kibria, who previously ran on the BNP's \"Sheaf of Paddy\" symbol in 2018, has remained inactive for some time but hinted that he is considering another run. \"I will contest from Habiganj-1, but I haven't decided under which banner yet,\" he said, adding that he has \"no hesitation\" about running again with BNP if the opportunity arises.Of these, Sheikh Sujat Mia, Mokhlesur Rahman, and Shah Mozammel Nantu have been particularly active on the ground, organising meetings and seminars to rally supporters. Mokhlesur Rahman, who is the lone BNP candidate from Bahubal Upazila, is seen as a strong contender. After returning from the UK following the August political upheaval, he reportedly secured several development allocations for the area, earning local appreciation.Except for Sabir Ahmed, all six others are expatriate leaders. Sheikh Sujat Mia, once a key organiser of anti-authoritarian movement in London, was denied nomination in the 2018 polls, when the BNP-led alliance fielded Dr Reza Kibria. Disappointed, Sujat left for England but has since returned following the recent political changes and is now conducting intensive mass outreach. Many local voters believe he currently enjoys a lead in the race.Former mayor Sabir Ahmed Chowdhury, meanwhile, has faced attacks and lawsuits for participating in anti-government protests but has remained loyal to his party and country. The other aspirants, too, are vying to gain visibility and favour from the BNP leadership through field-level engagement.In this key Habiganj constituency, Jamaat has already declared Md. Shahjahan Ali, Secretary of the party's Sylhet City unit, as its candidate. A native of Dattapara Village in Mirpur Union under Bahubal Upazila, he has been vigorously campaigning beyond regular party programmes.A fierce contest between the BNP and Jamaat candidates is anticipated.The KM has announced Principal Maulana Abdul Kaiyum Zaki, District's Joint General Secretary, as its candidate. Based in Bahubal - a stronghold of Islamic scholars - Zaki has been actively conducting door-to-door campaigns, holding meetings and gatherings in markets and villages, and is seen as being in a favourable position locally.Polash Mahmud, District Joint-Coordinator of NCP, and Abul Hossain Jibon, Central Joint General Secretary of Gono Odhikar Parishad (GOP), are also seeking nomination from their respective party.For IAB, Mufti Maulana Tajul Islam, Vice-President of Habiganj District Committee, is being discussed as a potential candidate, though no visible campaign activities have yet been observed.Jamiat Ulema has declared Maulana Siddiqur Rahman Chowdhury, General Secretary of District Committee, as its nominee, but his field presence remains minimal so far. However, former Jamiat student wing President Mufti Nizam Uddin Al Adnan - a nomination aspirant from the BNP-led alliance - has been actively campaigning, distributing greetings during national and religious festivals to build his local profile.No visible activity has been observed yet from the NCP or other political groups in the constituency.Many politically conscious voters believe that this year's national election will be particularly significant, marking a potential turning point towards a \"new Bangladesh free from fascism.\"HABIGANJ-2: This constituency consists of Baniachong and Ajmiriganj upazilas.This seat has 368,334 registered voters, including 182,188 women and 186,146 men.With two heavyweight BNP hopefuls vying for nomination and the influential KM leader known locally as \"Boro Huzur\" entering the fray, the constituency is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races in Sylhet Division.While Jamaat and the NCP are also in the field, they appear to be less popular. Historically dominated by the Awami League (AL), the seat is now witnessing a strong comeback bid by the BNP. Observers say the outcome will largely depend on two key voting blocs - the Hindu electorate of Ajmiriganj and the religiously conservative voters of Baniachong.In total, nine candidates from seven parties are currently active, though the main contest is emerging among the two BNP leaders and KM's charismatic figure, \"Boro Huzur.\" The final result, analysts say, may hinge on the Hindu vote swing and the influence of Islamic scholars in Baniachong.From the BNP, two seasoned leaders are seeking nomination. One is Dr. Sakhawat Hasan Jibon, Adviser to the BNP Chairperson and former organising secretary. \"I've served the party for decades and endured 14 false cases during the AL regime, 13 of which have been disproved in court,\" he told reporters. \"I spent years in Dhaka's prisons, organised over a hundred free medical camps, and stood beside injured activists and families of martyrs. Since 1979, when late Ali was elected MP from the BNP, no one else has been. Over the past 16 years, I have visited 486 villages and built networks down to every ward. In one upazila election, all BNP candidates won - proving our strength at the grassroots. If nominated, the people will surely accept me.\"His main rival within the BNP is Ahmed Ali Mukib Abdullah, the party's International Affairs Secretary and a close confidant of Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman. A long-time expatriate in Saudi Arabia, he returned home after 13 years following the fall of the AL government during the recent mass uprising. \"Bangladesh is politically free, but not yet truly independent,\" he said. \"We want the next election to pave the way for a new government. On behalf of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman, I've been visiting homes across the constituency. I've stood by the party for 16 years through its hardest times and spent from my own pocket. If nominated, I will gift this seat to our leader.\"Jamaat has declared Advocate Md. Zillur Rahman, President of the party's Hatirjheel thana unit in Dhaka, as its candidate.Although most of his political career has been Dhaka-based, he claims to have maintained strong local ties. However, local observers remain sceptical about whether he can overcome perceptions of being an \"outsider.\"Representing the NCP, former acting president of the Habiganj Chamber of Commerce and ex-student leader Abu Hena Mostafa Kamal has declared his intention to run. \"Bangladesh needs positive political change,\" he said. \"After the uprising, the NCP has been working towards that goal. I joined politics with honesty, and I believe people will accept me.\" Another NCP hopeful, Barrister Mostak Ahmed, is known locally for his contribution to education.IAB has nominated Baniachong Upazila President Mufti Hadisur Rahman, while Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam (Date Tree) has fielded Mufti Ekhlasur Rahman Riyad, Member Secretary of District Committee, as its sole candidate.On the other hand, KM Ameer Maulana Abdul Basit Azad, widely known as \"Boro Huzur,\" enjoys deep respect among local religious scholars and voters across communities. \"The people of Baniachong and Ajmiriganj have shown overwhelming support,\" he said. \"Scholars, imams, and ordinary citizens - regardless of religion or background - are working for me. I believe they will choose me as their representative.\"Azad, who once led a mass protest against the late AL veteran Suranjit Sengupta in 2001, famously drew crowds so large that Sengupta was unable to enter the area during that movement.From Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan (BKA), Maulana Habibur Rahman, District Committee President, is expected to contest under the \"Banyan Tree\" symbol.Most residents of Baniachong are Muslims, many of whom follow religious scholars while Ajmiriganj has a sizable Hindu population that has traditionally supported the AL. This time, however, political analysts say their voting direction remains uncertain.HABIGANJ-3: The constituency incorporates Lakhai, Habiganj Sadar and Shayestaganj upazilas.This seat has 409,629 registered voters, including 201,138 women and 208,492 men.However, the AL will remain out of the race in this constituency as the party's registration is currently suspended. The absence of the ruling party has opened the door for opposition and smaller parties, whose leaders are now working hard to consolidate voter support.From the BNP, two prominent figures are vying for the nomination: Alhaj GK Gaus, the party's Central Cooperative Affairs Secretary and current Organising Secretary for the Sylhet Division, and Dr Md Ahmadur Rahman Abdal, Joint Convener of the Habiganj District BNP.The Jamaat-e-Islami has put forward Kazi Mohsin, party's District General Secretary, as its candidate.JaPa is considering M.A. Munim Chowdhury Bulbul, a Central Committee member and Vice-President of the District chapter, for the ticket.Political analysts describe this seat as a historically important and politically sensitive constituency. They note that, apart from traditional party loyalties, voters this time are likely to prioritise issues such as local development, employment generation, and access to quality education and healthcare.BNP and Jatiya Party activists have already begun strengthening their organizational base, holding grassroots meetings, courtyard gatherings and public outreach programmes. Meanwhile, GOP has launched initiatives to attract first-time and young voters by introducing fresh district-level leadership.HABIGANJ-4: The constituency includes Chunarughat and Madhabpur upazilas.This seat has 512,308 registered voters, including 254,423 women, 257,884 men, and one third-gender voter.Like elsewhere in the country, BNP nomination seekers are now actively campaigning in the seat, attending meetings, social and sports events, and connecting with voters. After nearly 17 years of one-sided elections, voters here are eagerly waiting to exercise their right to vote again in the upcoming national polls.Speculation is rife in local markets and villages about who will secure the BNP ticket this time. Party sources say the BNP high command is conducting multiple surveys before finalising nominees. According to senior party insiders, preference will be given to those who played active roles in anti-government movements, faced arrests, and endured political persecution under the previous AL administration.Traditionally, their votes have largely gone to the AL's \"Boat\" symbol. However, this time, analysts say, the election outcome will once again hinge on the tea workers' votes. The candidate who can win their trust is likely to triumph in this constituency.Several BNP leaders have already entered the race for nomination. They include former lawmaker and ex-district BNP president Syed Mohammad Faisal, Central BNP Vice-President of the Nationalist Lawyers' Forum and party's Legal Adviser Advocate Aminul Islam, former MP and BNP Assistant Secretary for Local Government Affairs Shammi Akter, and District Joint Convener Advocate Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury.Upazila Swechchhasebak Dal Member Secretary Faridur Rahman said he believes Syed Mohammad Faisal - Chairman of the Saiham Group - deserves the party nomination. Faisal, who has been financing numerous social and development initiatives through Saiham Group, is seen by many as a strong contender. \"If the party nominates him, BNP's chances of crossing the electoral river will be much higher,\" Rahman added.Sources point out that this seat has never been won by the BNP; it has long been dominated by the AL, while the JaPa held it in 1986 and 1988.Veteran journalist Waliullah Noman, known as a vocal critic of Sheikh Hasina's regime, is also lobbying to contest the seat - either as a BNP nominee or under an allied banner.District BNP Joint Convener Advocate Mizanur Rahman, known for his integrity and anti-fascist activism, is another strong contender. His grassroots credibility has earned him broad acceptance among local party workers.Meanwhile, Jamaat has declared Kazi Maulana Mokhlesur Rahman, District Ameer, as its candidate. Determined to make inroads into the BNP and tea workers' vote banks, Jamaat activists are campaigning door to door to mobilise support for him. Their target is clear - to secure a surprise victory for Mokhlesur Rahman in the election.While BNP leaders remain preoccupied with internal meetings and factional divides, Jamaat workers are quietly strengthening grassroots networks and building direct voter connections, making the party organisationally stronger in Chunarughat-Madhabpur. \"They are aiming to make a breakthrough this time,\" said one local observer.The KM has nominated its Central Secretary General Dr. Ahmad Abdul Kader, while Jamiat-e-Ulema has fielded Maulana Hakim Nuruzzaman, District Vice-President, who is actively campaigning across the constituency.Local residents say , in the absence of AL, BNP stands a strong chance due to its loyal vote base. However, internal rifts within the BNP remain a major challenge. As political calculations evolve, Habiganj-4 is emerging as a constituency where alliances, organisational unity, and the tea workers' loyalty could ultimately determine who wears the victory garland.",

    "body": "JHALAKATHI, a scenic district in southern Bangladesh, is known for its sprawling rivers, fertile lands, and rich cultural heritage, which not only enhance its natural beauty but also play a vital role in the livelihood of its residents. Located in the Barishal Division and bordered by Barishal, Pirojpur, Patuakhali, and Barguna districts, Jhalakathi has long served as an important hub for trade and agriculture in southern Bangladesh.At the heart of the district lies its town, a charming river port and the administrative centre of the district. The town is situated on the northern bank of the Sugandha River and flanked by the Gabkhan Khal and Dhanshiri rivers, which historically made it a thriving centre of commerce. From ancient times, traders and merchants relied on these waterways to transport goods, establishing the town as a prominent business hub.The district has a rich administrative history. Jhalakathi subdivision was created in 1972, shortly after Bangladesh gained independence, and it was elevated to full district status in 1984. According to the 2022 Census of Bangladesh, the district has 162,401 households with a population of 661,160, averaging 4.02 people per household.Jhalakathi's fertile soil and extensive river networks make it ideal for agriculture. The district is particularly renowned for high-quality betel leaves, locally called \"Paan\", which are considered among the finest in the country. Generations of farmers have relied on betel leaf cultivation as a major source of income, and local markets and fairs continue to attract traders from across Bangladesh. In recent years, the district has also gained recognition for pears and winter vegetables, adding further economic significance to its agricultural sector.The district's natural beauty is another draw. Lush green fields, flowing rivers, and gentle hills create a picturesque landscape that supports fishing, boating, and ecotourism. Rivers like the Bishkhali and Sugandha have historically served as trade routes and today offer scenic views for visitors seeking tranquillity.Education and healthcare have also seen notable progress. The district hosts several schools, colleges, and vocational institutions that produce skilled professionals while local health initiatives have helped improve community welfare.With the 13th Jatiya Sangsad election approaching, political activities in Jhalakathi are intensifying. Even before the official election schedule was announced, nomination hopefuls have begun active campaigning across the district's two constituencies. In the absence of the visible presence of Awami League (AL), the main electoral contest in both seats appears to be confined to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB) is also active in the district.As the election season heats up, Jhalakathi stands at a crossroads of history, culture, and politics. Its rivers and fertile lands continue to sustain livelihoods, while its residents prepare to shape the district's political future.JHALAKATHI-1: The constituency consists of Rajapur and Kathalia upazilas along the Bishkhali River.This parliamentary area has 225,224 registered voters, including 114,511 men, 110,712 women, and one third-gender voter.Historically, several heavyweight politicians have been elected from this seat and later served as ministers and state ministers, which gives the constituency special significance.The seat has long been regarded as a BNP stronghold. This time, however, multiple BNP aspirants are in the race for the party nomination, creating intense internal competition. Political observers note that if Jamaat-backed independent candidate and IAB join hands, BNP could face a tough challenge even in its traditional base.Meanwhile, confident of their chances, several BNP hopefuls have launched extensive campaigns. Among the key contenders are BNP Central Executive Committee's Religious Affairs Secretary Rafiqul Islam Jamal, New York South BNP President Habibur Rahman Salim Reza, former central assistant organizing secretary of Jatiyatabadi Chatra Dal Golam Azom Shaikat, former Constitution Reform Commission member and think tank leader Barrister M. Moyeen Alam Firozi, Colonel (Retd) Mostafizur Rahman, former vice-president of Jatiyatabadi Swechchhasebak Dal Rafiq Hawlader, and Nationalist Research Centre President Engineer A.K.M. Rezaul Karim.Interestingly, out of the eight BNP hopefuls, all except Rafiqul Islam Jamal are conducting joint campaign programmes and participating in party activities together - a rare show of unity within the party's grassroots.On the Islamist front, Dr Faizul Haq, grandson of the revered religious leader Qaid Saheb Hujur and an online activist, is contesting as an independent candidate with open support from the District unit of Jamaat. He has already begun vigorous campaigning alongside local Jamaat activists.The National Citizen Party (NCP) is yet to announce a candidate, but BNP's ally, Bangladesh Labour Party, has confirmed that its chairman, Dr Mostafizur Rahman Iran, will contest from this constituency.The IAB has also announced its candidate for the seat - the party's District General Secretary Ibrahim Al Hadi.Rafiqul Islam Jamal, who lost to AL candidate Bazlul Haque Harun in the 2008 polls as a BNP nominee, said he expects the party will recognise his contributions.\"I have faced imprisonment and persecution for standing firm against fascism and for supporting our activists during the party's hard times. I believe the party will now value my sacrifices,\" he said.Habibur Rahman Salim Reza said, \"If nominated, I will bring unprecedented development to Rajapur and Kathalia.\"Former Chatra Dal leader Golam Azom Shaikat, who has spent two terms in jail, said, he was receiving strong public support this time. \"I hope the party will nominate me for my dedication and sacrifices,\" he added.Barrister Moyeen Alam Firozi said the seat currently suffers from a leadership crisis. \"The people want a candidate with a clean image, and I believe I can meet that expectation,\" he said.Colonel (Retd) Mostafizur Rahman, who joined BNP in September 2023 along with 25 other ex-army officers, said, \"We were active during the July Movement. I hope the party will recognize my contribution.\"Independent candidate Dr Faizul Haq said, he would contest with support from Jamaat and other Islamic parties. \"I have always stood by the people of this area, providing scholarships to students and working for the community. If elected, I will promote harmony among all faiths,\" he said.JHALAKATHI-2: The constituency comprises Jhalakathi Sadar and Nalchity upazilas.This seat has 360,368 registered voters, including 182,637 men, 177,999 women, and two third-gender voters.Here, too, BNP faces a similar scenario - at least eight aspirants are vying for the party nomination, while Jamaat and IAB have single candidate. The JaPa and left-leaning groups have no visible activity in the area.Prominent BNP hopefuls include Dr S.M. Ziauddin Hyder Swapon, former World Bank health and nutrition specialist and current Adviser to the BNP Chairperson; Mahbubul Haq Nannu, BNP Assistant Organizing Secretary and former vice-president of Barishal BM College Student Union; former MP Israt Sultana Ellen Bhutto; Advocate Shahadat Hossain, Member Secretary of the District BNP and President of the Jhalakathi Bar Association; Zeeba Amina Al Gazi, Vice-President of Jatiyatabadi Mohila Dal; and Barrister Zahirul Islam Sumon, central leader of the Nationalist Lawyers' Forum.Dr Ziauddin Hyder, a former president of Barishal Medical College Chatra Dal, said he was not competing for nomination but would accept the party's decision. \"If the high command thinks I am suitable, I am ready to contest,\" he said.Mahbubul Haq Nannu, who has been jailed multiple times for his political activism, said, \"If the party evaluates dedication and sacrifices, I'm hopeful about nomination.\"Former MP Ishrat Sultana Ellen Bhutto, who defeated AL heavyweight Amir Hossain Amu in 2001, said, she remains confident of being nominated again.\"I believe I can bring victory to the party by a wide margin,\" she said.Advocate Shahadat Hossain, a key figure in reorganising the District BNP, said he had faced multiple attacks and lawsuits during political unrest. \"If the party values past struggles, I'm confident about getting the ticket,\" he added.Zeeba Amina Al Gazi, who contested in 2018, said she faced repeated attacks and harassment but continued to stand by grassroots activists. \"I believe the party will now reward that dedication,\" she added.Barrister Zahirul Islam Sumon, a long-time BNP loyalist, said he would seek nomination, confident that his service during difficult times would be recognised.From Jamaat-e-Islami, Neamul Karim, former AGS of Barishal BM College Student Union and Central Office Secretary of Islami Chhatra Shibir, has been nominated. He has already begun door-to-door campaigning across Sadar and Nalchity upazilas with support from party activists.Although IAB is yet to formally announce its candidate, sources said its presidium member and noted preacher Dr Sirajul Islam Siraji, a former atheist turned Muslim scholar, has been engaging in active campaigning and meeting voters.Political analysts say the absence of AL from the electoral scene could offer BNP an advantage in Jhalakathi . However, internal divisions and potential unity among Islamist parties may reshape the outcome.\"If Jamaat, IAB, and independent Islamic candidates coordinate, the electoral picture in this southern district could take a dramatic turn,\" said one local political observer.",

    "body": "As the contest intensifies, one thing is clear: in the absence of the AL, Narsingdi-4 has emerged as a crucial battleground for the BNP and its ideological allies-where the competition remains active, disciplined, and highly unpredictable.\n\nNARSINGDI, a district in central Bangladesh, is renowned for its rich tapestry of culture, industry, and natural beauty. Located just 50 kilometres northeast of Dhaka, it has earned national recognition for several reasons-most notably its thriving textile industry, historical significance, and strategic political importance.Narsingdi is often dubbed the \"Manchester of Bangladesh\" due to its booming handloom and power loom sectors. The district is a major hub for producing high-quality sarees, lungis, and other garments, especially in areas like Baburhat and Shekherchar. These products are distributed across the country and even exported abroad, making Narsingdi a vital contributor to Bangladesh's economy. Thousands of families are engaged in weaving, dyeing, and trading, and the local markets bustle with textile commerce year-round.Geographically, Narsingdi is blessed with the flow of several major rivers, including the Meghna, Old Brahmaputra, Arial Khan, and Kankon. These rivers not only enrich the soil for agriculture but also shape the district's identity as a \"land of rivers.\" The fertile plains support the cultivation of rice, jute, sugarcane, and vegetables, sustaining both local consumption and trade. The scenic beauty of these waterways adds to Narsingdi's charm, attracting visitors and photographers alike.The district has deep historical roots, with archaeological evidence suggesting links to ancient civilizations. The name \"Narsingdi\" is believed to be derived from the Hindu deity Narasingha, and the region has long been a melting pot of religious and cultural diversity. Historic mosques, temples, and colonial-era structures dot the landscape, reflecting its layered past. Cultural organisations and festivals continue to thrive, preserving traditions while embracing modernity.With the 13th Jatiya Sangsad election approaching, the political landscape of this district is buzzing. Election banners, rallies, and processions are now common sights here, signalling a renewed political energy. Candidates are pledging infrastructure development, improved law and order, and social welfare reforms-issues that resonate deeply with the district's diverse population. With veteran politicians, new-generation leaders, and Islamic party candidates all vying for prominence, the district is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched battlegrounds in the upcoming national polls.NARSINGDI-1: The constituency encompasses all but three union parishads of Narsingdi Sadar Upazila.It has 441,436 registered voters, including 226,739 male, 214,690 female, and 7 third-gender voters.A number of heavyweight opposition figures are expected to contest in this seat. Veteran leader of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Khayrul Kabir Khokon, a former MP and prominent voice within the party, is among the leading aspirants. He is expected to be joined by Harun-or-Rashid (Harun), son of late four-time MP Shamsuddin Ahmed Ishak and currently Vice-President of the District BNP.Md. Ibrahim Bhuiyan has been nominated as the MP candidate of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami for the upcoming national election. The party's Policy Making Forum officially announced his name as the candidate recently, a reliable source within Jamaat confirmed.According to the source, Md. Ibrahim Bhuiyan previously served as the branch manager of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited in Narsingdi District and later held the position of Senior Vice-Chairman of the bank. He is currently the President of the Professional Wing of District Jamaat.Maulana Shawkat Hossain Sarkar, appointed as the President of Hefazat-e-Islam's District unit, has recently announced candidacy from the Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB).Meanwhile, Advocate Shirin Akhter Shely, Joint Convener of the National citizen Party (NCP) and a social worker, has declared her intention to contest, hoping to represent a new political alternative in the constituency.While the final line-up will be confirmed only after the election schedule is announced, sources indicate that all major parties may reconsider their candidates depending on alliance negotiations and electoral strategies.NARSINGDI-2: The constituency incorporators Palash Upazila and three union parishads of Narsingdi Sadar Upazila: Amdia, Meher Para, and Panchdona.The constituency has 269,253 registered voters, including 137,778 male, 131,472 female, and 3 third-gender voters.The political temperature in this seat is particularly high. Here, BNP, Jamaat, NCP, IAB, Jamiate Ulema Islam, and Khelafat Majlis have all become active in the field. At the centre of discussion stands Dr. Abdul Moyeen Khan, BNP Standing Committee Member, former minister, and ex-MP, who remains one of the district's most influential figures.Party insiders say that during BNP's time in power, Dr. Moyeen Khan initiated several development projects in Palash, earning him strong grassroots support. Now, backed by enthusiastic local leaders and activists, he has resumed campaign activities in anticipation of nomination as BNP's sole candidate for the seat.Other parties are also preparing to contest. Jamaat has declared Maulana Amjad Hossain, a member of its Central Majlis-e-Shura.Sarwar Hossain Tushar, Joint Convener of the NCP, is likely to be a strong candidate from this seat.Engineer Mohsin Ahmed, a local industrialist, will run for the IAB while Mufti Abdur Rahim Qasemi, District President of Jamiate Ulema, is also in the race.The multi-party competition in this constituency is expected to be fierce, with BNP aiming to reclaim its past influence while the Islamist bloc seeks to expand its voter base.NARSINGDI-3: This constituency covers Shibpur Upazila.There are a total of 263,723 registered voters in the area, including 133,751 men, 129,971 women, and one third-gender voter.The nomination race is equally lively here. From BNP, District Vice-President Tofazzal Hossain Master, General Secretary Monjur Elahi, Central Executive Committee Member and former general secretary of the Chatra Dal Akramul Hasan Mintu are key contenders. Abul Haris Rikabdar, President of the Upazila BNP, and Ariful Islam Mridha representing the Mannan Bhuiyan Parishad as an independent candidate, are also in the field.Jamaat-e-Islami has declared Mostafizur Rahman Kawser, Ameer of the party's Shibpur Upazila unit, as its candidate.Abdullahil Mamun Niloy, a Central Committee Member, is expected to contest in the election from the NCP.From the IAB, Maulana Wayeze Hossain Bhuiyan, Central Vice-President of Islami Sramik Andolan (workers wing of IAB), will run as a candidate.NARSINGDI-4: The constituency includes Belabo and Manohardi upazilas.The total number of registered voters in this seat is 402,610, including 199,781 men, 202,827 women, and two third-gender voters.Located in the northern part of the district, the constituency-renowned as an educational hub-holds strategic political importance.Although BNP is yet to finalise its nomination, three potential candidates are actively campaigning, engaging in an organised and competitive effort to strengthen their grassroots base. Through continuous public interactions, worker meetings, and community programmes, they are striving to solidify their individual positions ahead of the party's final decision.Among the frontrunners, Bir Muktijoddha Sardar Shakhawat Hossain Bakul, a former MP and Senior Vice-President of the District BNP, stands out as a popular contender. Known for his experience, wartime legacy, and strong ties with both party activists and the general electorate, Bakul is seen as a trusted leader. His long political career and loyal support from local BNP and affiliated bodies across two upazilas have further bolstered his candidacy. Local political observers believe his grassroots acceptability gives him an edge in the nomination race.Another prominent name is Lt. Col. (Retd) Zainal Abedin, BNP's National Executive Committee Member and Liberation War Affairs Secretary. A decorated freedom fighter, Zainal is appealing to voters through his record of patriotism and service to the nation. His leadership during BNP's challenging years has earned him respect within the party ranks. Recently, he has been seen presenting BNP's 31-point reform agenda-announced by Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman-at several grassroots meetings, positioning himself as a disciplined and visionary candidate committed to restoring democratic governance.The third strong contender, Abdul Kader Bhuiyan Jewel, Assistant Secretary for Volunteer Affairs in BNP and a former president of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, represents the new generation of leadership. Campaigning under the slogan \"Let the youth's first vote go to BNP\", Jewel is focusing on mobilising young voters. His energetic campaign combines traditional public meetings with extensive use of social media, door-to-door visits, and courtyard discussions. Party insiders describe him as a rising leader capable of bridging the generational gap within BNP.Meanwhile, Maulana Md. Jahangir Alam, district Assistant Secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami is seen as another formidable contender. As the lone candidate of his party in this constituency, his organizational network and past visibility-he previously served as an elected vice-chairman during an Awami League (AL) administration-may give him an additional advantage. His ongoing efforts to reinforce his position across the constituency have been noted, although political analysts say the overall scenario remains fluid and dependent on future alliances among Islamist parties.Other Islamic parties are also making their presence felt. Maulana Md. Saifullah Pradhan, Manohardi Upazila President of IAB and Maulana Md. Nasir Al Faridi, Belabo Upazila President of Khelafat Majlis have both begun individual campaigns. Discussions are underway about the possibility of a united Islamic alliance, which could substantially strengthen their electoral influence.Within BNP, enthusiasm and curiosity continue to grow over who will ultimately secure the party's nomination. All three leading aspirants-Bakul, Zainal, and Jewel-are following Tarique Rahman's 31-point roadmap, engaging the public with issue-based politics and pledges of reform.Party insiders expect the final nomination decision to come from the BNP high command at the appropriate time. Until then, the three contenders are racing to expand their reach and visibility among voters.NARSINGDI-5: This constituency covers Raipura Upazila.It has a total of 455,297 registered voters, including 234,096 men, 221,187 women, and 14 third-gender voters.Enriched by the flow of four major rivers - the Meghna, the Old Brahmaputra, the Arial Khan, and the Kankon - Raipura is often described as the \"land of rivers\" in Narsingdi District. The constituency includes 24 unions and one municipality and features six railway stations within its boundary.Over the decades, this vast and strategically significant constituency has seen shifting political tides. While it has largely remained a stronghold of the AL in recent years, history tells a more competitive story. In 1988, Moin Uddin Bhuiyan of the Jatiya Party (JaPa) was elected as Member of Parliament. The BNP then captured the seat twice - in the 1991 and 1996 elections - through its candidate Abdul Ali Mridha.Since then, the AL's veteran leader Rajiuddin Ahmed Raju has held the seat for seven consecutive terms, keeping it under the party's firm control until the downfall of Sheikh Hasina's government.Within the BNP, at least six aspirants are vying for nomination. They have been organising grassroots campaigns, attending local events, and reactivating the party's dormant networks. Among them, Engineer Ashraf Uddin Bokul, the party's Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology Affairs and an adviser to Amra BNP Paribar, contested the 2018 election with the 'Sheaf of Paddy' symbol.Confident about securing the nomination again, Bokul said, \"I was on the streets before, and I still am. I never fled the movement. During the AL regime, it was difficult even to hold a meeting or distribute posters, yet I continued working for the party and its imprisoned activists. Now, many fair-weather politicians are coming forward for nominations, but I was there during the hard times.\"Another key contender is Jamal Ahmed Chowdhury, Vice-President of the District BNP and former member of the party's Executive Committee. He contested the 2008 election under the BNP-led four-party alliance and reportedly received one of the highest vote counts for the 'Sheaf of Paddy' symbol in greater Dhaka District.\"I have always stood by the party,\" said Jamal Chowdhury. \"If nominated and elected, my priorities will be improving law and order situation in Raipura and constructing the long-demanded Meghna Bridge to boost connectivity in the char areas.\" He also recalled suffering severe spinal injuries during a police attack on a procession during Khaleda Zia's 2013 visit.Mohsin Hossain Bidyut, Senior Joint General Secretary of District BNP and President of Jubo Dal, is also seeking nomination from his party.Other potential BNP nominees include District BNP's Organising Secretary Rafiqul Amin Bhuiyan Ruhel; Dhaka Metropolitan Muktijoddha Dal General Secretary and former Raipura BNP president MN Zaman; District BNP's Local Government Affairs Secretary Jahangir Alam Badal; former Jatiyatabadi Chatra Dal general secretary and BNP Executive Committee Member Iqbal Hossain Shyamal.Jahangir Alam Badal, confident about his chances, noted that a primary and a high school after his name exist in the area, reflecting his contribution to local education. \"If I get the nomination,\" he said, \"I will prioritise building embankments to prevent river erosion, expanding gas connections, and improving education and social safety systems.\"While the BNP's internal race continues, Jamaat-e-Islami has also stepped up its visibility in Raipura. Maulana Mohammad Jahangir Alam, Ameer of the party's Raipura Sadar unit, has been nominated as Jamaat's candidate for the upcoming election. He is actively campaigning across the constituency, engaging with voters and seeking their support. His efforts reflect Jamaat's commitment to strengthening its presence and influence in the region.From the NCP, Central leader Abdullah Faisal, is expected to contest the election. However, so far, he has not been seen conducting any visible public outreach in the area.IAB is very much active. Maulana Badruzzaman, Executive Director of the popular religious-cultural organization Kolorob Shilpi Gosthi, is seeking nomination from the party. He has already conducted campaigns in several unions, engaging with voters and promising development initiatives.",

Let us preserve the sanctity of Ramadan.”He prayed that Almighty Allah accept the fasting, prayers, charity and all righteous deeds of the people, grant them the ability to apply the lessons of Ramadan in their lives, forgive and protect everyone and bless the country and the nation with peace and prosperity.SH",

    "body": "Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam has said that police force regained its self-respect through its role in the national election, highlighting what he described as a confident and professional performance.He made the remarks on Sunday at a press conference held at Foreign Service Academy in the capital.Shafiqul Alam said the cabinet observed that the election had helped restore the morale and dignity of police.Referring to the force’s controversial role during July–August 2024, he noted that many had questioned whether the police, amid concerns about low confidence, would be able to ensure a credible election.“There was discussion about whether we would be able to witness a good election with this police force,” he said, adding that officers had performed their duties well.He said body-worn cameras were used extensively for the first time on such a large scale.The Chief Adviser personally monitored the situation from Police Headquarters for about an hour and a half and directly communicated with 17 polling centres.The cabinet hopes that wider deployment of body cameras in future elections will yield even better results, he added.He also mentioned that “Surokkha” app played an important role in coordinating election officials.According to him, CCTV surveillance was also helpful during the polls. Referring to remarks by Home Adviser, Shafiqul said four deaths were reported after the election, but only one was directly linked to election-related violence.Regarding an incident involving a woman in Hatiya, he said a probe committee would be formed to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter.Senior Assistant Press Secretary to Chief Adviser Faiz Ahmed and Assistant Press Secretary Suchismita Tithi, among others, were present at the briefing.SH",

    "body": "A Mandate After Years of Political Turbulence\n\nCall for Unity Across Political Divides\n\nCommitment to Reform and the 31-Point Agenda\n\nAppeal for Peace and Lawfulness\n\nTribute to Democratic Struggles\n\nVision for the Future\n\nBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairman Tarique Rahman on Saturday declared that “we are all free from today,” and called for unity stating that \"national unity is our strength while division weakness'.Addressing the post-election press conference at Hotel InterContinental in the capital following his party’s decisive victory in the 13th parliamentary elections, Tarique thanked voters across the country for returning the BNP to power through what he described as a peaceful, competitive and participatory election.He characterized the outcome as a triumph not only for his party but for democracy and the people of Bangladesh.“Freedom-loving and democracy-loving citizens have once again chosen the BNP. This victory belongs to Bangladesh, to democracy and to the people who aspire to democratic governance,” Tarique said.Tarique said the election marked a significant turning point for the country, coming after years of political unrest and what he termed authoritarian governance. He noted that Bangladesh is now entering a new phase, with an elected parliament and government directly accountable to voters for the first time in over a decade.He acknowledged that the incoming administration would face serious challenges, including what he described as a fragile economy, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a strained law and order situation. “We are beginning this journey in a difficult environment,” he said, adding that rebuilding institutions and restoring public confidence would be top priorities.The BNP chief emphasized that broad public participation in the election helped re-establish democratic legitimacy. He thanked the interim government and the Election Commission for organizing the polls and credited judicial officials, members of the armed forces, civil administration personnel and law enforcement agencies for their roles in ensuring a smooth process. He also recognized the contribution of domestic and international media and election observers.Tarique underscored the importance of national unity, warning that division could weaken the country’s democratic gains. “National unity is our strength; division is our weakness,” he said.He noted that 51 political parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami, NCP, Islami Andolon Bangladesh, Jamiatul Islam and Gono Odhikar Parishad, took part in the election. Congratulating all participating parties, he said a functioning democracy requires both a responsible government and an effective opposition.“Our paths and opinions may differ, but when it comes to the country, we are one,” Tarique said, calling on all democratic forces to contribute ideas and work collectively toward rebuilding the nation.Tarique reiterated the BNP’s commitment to its previously announced 31-point reform outline aimed at “repairing the state.” He said the party developed the reform plan through consultations with other democratic forces and citizens nationwide and incorporated it into its election manifesto.He also confirmed that the BNP signed the July Charter, with certain notes of dissent on specific issues, and pledged that commitments made to the public would be implemented gradually and responsibly.“We will fulfill each promise we have made to the people,” he said, stressing that restoring the rule of law, strengthening democratic institutions, curbing corruption and improving governance would form the foundation of the new government’s agenda.Despite celebrating what he described as a sweeping mandate, Tarique urged party leaders and supporters across the country to remain calm and avoid any actions that could trigger unrest. He said he had instructed BNP activists not to hold victory processions to prevent potential clashes or provocation.“Under no circumstances should peace and order be disrupted,” he said. “We will not tolerate injustice, unlawful acts or attacks by the strong against the weak, regardless of political affiliation, religion or opinion.”He warned that any post-election misunderstandings between rival candidates or supporters must not escalate into revenge or violence. “The rule of law must prevail equally for every citizen, whether in government or opposition,” he added.Tarique paid tribute to those who lost their lives or were injured in past movements for democracy, referencing the country’s long political struggle from the 1971 Liberation War to recent protests. He offered prayers for deceased leaders, including former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and said their sacrifices would not be forgotten.“The democratic Bangladesh we celebrate today stands on the sacrifices of many,” he said.Concluding his remarks, Tarique said the BNP had been given a renewed mandate to govern and must now deliver tangible improvements in living standards. He called on party members and citizens alike to act responsibly in rebuilding the country.“We must repay the trust and love shown by the people through dedicated service and hard work,” he said. “Let us move forward together to build a safe, humane and democratic Bangladesh.”He ended his address by thanking democratic forces around the world, expatriate Bangladeshis and citizens at home for their support, reaffirming his commitment to unity and democratic governance.",

    "title": "BNP faces nomination battles; Jamaat strengthens bases; NCP, IAB, Khelafat Majlis join race in Jashore",
    "body": "JASHORE, a district in south-western Bangladesh, proudly holds the distinction of being the country's first digital district. Nestled along the banks of the Kabatak River, Jashore is both historically rich and economically significant. Established in 1781, it is one of the oldest and largest districts in Bangladesh. Administratively falling under the Khulna Division, the district enjoys substantial political and strategic importance and is often celebrated as the \"Flower Capital\" of Bangladesh.Classified as an \"A\"-grade district due to the number of its upazilas, Jashore-also traditionally spelled as \"Jashohor\"-boasts a long legacy of culture, education, and infrastructural development. It is also noteworthy for being the first district to achieve liberation from colonial rule in Bangladesh, further cementing its place in the country's historical narrative.Jashore's historical roots trace back several centuries. Around 1450 AD, the revered Pir Khan Jahan Ali, along with twelve other saints, established a centre in Murali to promote Islam. This centre gradually developed into Murali Kasba, a significant town that would later form the heart of Jashore. By 1555, the Jashore Kingdom was founded, covering areas of present-day Jashore, Khulna, Bongaon, and parts of Kushtia and Faridpur.In 1747, the territory came under the rule of Queen Bhavani of Natore. Eventually, in 1781, Jashore emerged as a separate district, a status that was later reinforced with the establishment of Jashore Municipality in 1864. Over the centuries, the district has developed a strong tradition of education and public services. Notable establishments include the Jashore Zilla School, founded in 1838, and the Jashore Public Library, opened in 1851. These institutions contributed significantly to the intellectual and cultural growth of the region.During the 20th century, Jashore experienced major infrastructural advancements. The construction of Jashore Airport and the establishment of rail links connecting Kolkata and Khulna helped integrate the district into regional trade networks. Jashore's strategic and patriotic significance was underscored during the Liberation War of 1971, when it became the first district in Bangladesh to be freed from Pakistani occupation forces.Education has remained a cornerstone of Jashore's development. Since 1963, the district has hosted the Jashore Education Board, which oversees educational institutions in the region. More recently, Jashore has emerged as a hub for information technology in southern Bangladesh, with the establishment of the Jashore IT Park, the largest IT facility in the area. The district's airport, besides serving civilian needs, functions as a critical base for the Bangladesh Air Force. It is unique in the country as the only airport where all airmen are trained in aviation operations.Economically, Jashore thrives due to the presence of Benapole Land Port in Sharsha Upazila, the largest and most important border port in Bangladesh. Facilitating a majority of trade between Bangladesh and India-especially with Petrapole on the Indian side-Benapole plays a pivotal role in customs revenue collection. Many locals earn livelihood through import-export businesses, customs clearing operations, and associated trade services.The district's commercial hub, Nawapara, hosts numerous local and regional enterprises, industries, and factories. In addition to land-based trade, Jashore participates actively in waterway commerce, contributing substantially to the national economy.As Bangladesh approaches its 13th Jatiya Sangsad election, political fervour is sweeping across the south-western district of Jashore. Historically known as a hub of culture, trade, and education, Jashore is now witnessing heightened political activity in all four of its constituencies. With the dominant Awami League (AL) stepping back following the August 5 student-led upheaval, the spotlight has shifted to opposition parties, primarily the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, along with other parties like National Citizen Party (NCP), Bangladesh Khelafat Majlis (BKM), and Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB).The upcoming national elections promise to further shape Jashore's political profile. With intense nomination battles in constituencies like Jashore-1 and active campaigning by multiple parties, the district is witnessing a political awakening reminiscent of its historical significance. For Jashore, the intertwining of history, economy, and politics continues to define its unique place in Bangladesh's national narrative.JASHORE-1: This constituency covers Sharsha Upazila.This parliamentary area consisting of one municipality and 11 union councils has historically been AL stronghold.In the past 12 elections, the AL has won nine times including three fake elections, BNP three times, and Jamaat-e-Islami once. Some uncontested elections during the AL's rule and the 15 February election during BNP's tenure are also notable in the constituency's electoral history. Elections under former military ruler H.M. Ershad, including controversial \"Saheb-Bibi-Golam\" elections, are also part of the record.Ahead of upcoming national election, Jamaat-e-Islami announced its candidate early, while BKM declared its nominee on August 8. The IAB has also officially announced its candidate. However, BNP has not yet finalised its candidate list, making the situation complex. At least five prominent BNP leaders are currently in contention for nomination, and the party has emphasised that once a candidate is chosen, all supporters will rally behind them. Party insiders suggest that a single nominee will ultimately represent BNP in the election, with the final decision being a strategic \"last-minute\" move.This election cycle is markedly different. Following the student-led uprising on August 5, the AL stepped back, and the party's activities were suspended due to charges of human rights violations. Consequently, the political dynamics in Jashore-1 have shifted, leaving BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami as the primary contenders.Jamaat's candidate, Maulana Azizur Rahman, a Central Committee Member, previously contested this constituency in 2008. Party workers have been actively campaigning on his behalf, employing strategies ranging from public rallies to online promotions. Maulana Azizur Rahman emphasised that their campaign is focused on educating voters about their responsibilities and the party's agenda, while also striving to foster unity among residents regardless of political, religious, or social affiliations. He noted that promoting cohesion would reduce violent incidents and contribute to national peace.The BKM has nominated Maulana Mahabubur Rahman, the party's Sharsha Upazila President. IAB's candidate is Bakhtiar Hossain, also Upazila President.The BNP has several contenders for Sharsha nomination, including former central office secretary and ex-MP Mofiqul Hasan Tripti, Sharsha Upazila BNP President Hasan Zahir, General Secretary Nuruzzaman Liton, former Upazila president Khairuzzaman Madhu, and former central leader Mohasin Kabir. Reports suggest that the final contest will primarily be among Mofiqul Hasan Tripti, Hasan Zahir, and Nuruzzaman Liton.Mofiqul Hasan Tripti enjoys strong grassroots support, having overseen several developmental initiatives during BNP's tenure. He also contested the 2018 elections but withdrew due to alleged electoral irregularities. Hasan Zahir has also maintained close ties with grassroots supporters, having been elected Union Council chairman twice.Nuruzzaman Liton, a young and popular leader, is influential in the northern parts of Sharsha. Before becoming Upazila BNP general secretary, he led the student and volunteer wings of the party, building a robust network of activists. Meanwhile, former Sharsha BNP president Khairuzzaman Madhu and Mohasin Kabir have not remained active in the constituency's politics.JASHORE-2: This constituency comprises Jhikargachha and Chowgachha upazilas.It has long been a constituency with colourful local narratives.Over the years, some locals have humorously referred to it as a seat \"reserved for guests,\" while others allege that the ruling party in recent terms used it as a quota to reward loyal associates. Since Bangladesh's independence, many elected representatives from this constituency have been jokingly called \"imports\" by locals, implying outsiders or party-favoured candidates. Whether the same will happen in the upcoming election remains to be seen, but voter engagement in Jhikargacha and Chowgacha has already started to rise.At present, six BNP leaders are actively engaged with voters. They are visiting communities, understanding local needs, and providing assistance where possible. Party insiders believe, however, that the contest for the BNP nomination will ultimately narrow to two key figures: Sabira Nazmul Munni, former chairman of Jhikargacha Upazila Parishad and Upazila BNP President, and Mizanur Rahman Khan, President of the Jashore Chamber of Commerce and former joint general Secretary of Jashore District BNP.Other potential BNP aspirants include Advocate Mohammad Ishak, former chairman of Jashore Municipality and ex-president of the Jashore District Lawyers' Association; Jahurul Islam, former president of Chowgachha Upazila BNP; Mortuza Elahi Tipu, former president of Jhikargachha Upazila BNP; and Imran Hasan Samad Nipun, General Secretary of Jhikargachha Upazila BNP.Meanwhile, Jamaat has refreshed its candidate line-up. Initially, the party had nominated Maulana Arshadul Alam, a local resident and Assistant Professor at Jhikargachha Gazi Dargah Madrasa. However, months later, the party replaced him with Dr. Mosleh Uddin Farid, a UK-based paediatric cardiologist and intensive care specialist who returned home upon receiving the nomination. Dr. Farid hails from a prominent Jashore family; his father, late Professor Sharif Hossain, was a leading figure in the government college's library movement, and Dr. Farid was born in the city's Kharki area. Jamaat's grassroots network has been actively campaigning for him through public meetings, online outreach, and community engagement.BKM has also announced its candidate, Maulana Kamal Hossain, a former secretary of the Jashore District Committee. IAB is considering Idris Ali Master, a leader from the National Teachers' Council, as a potential candidate. The NCP, while expressing intent to contest, is yet to finalise its candidate due to ongoing organizational restructuring in the district.JASHORE-3: This constituency covers Sadar Upazila of the district.The seat has emerged as another high-stakes battleground.BNP's sole candidate for the constituency is Anindya Islam Amit, son of former minister Tariqul Islam, who previously represented this seat in the 6th and 8th Jatiya Sangsad elections. Amit currently serves as the Acting Divisional Organizational Secretary for Khulna Division and has taken the lead in both organizational politics and election campaigning.Amit is focused on reviving the political prestige of the constituency, which has seen diminished influence over the years. Widely respected at the grassroots level across the Khulna Division, he has earned a strong reputation for supporting BNP activists during challenging periods under Hasina's administration. His deep connections with local communities and long-standing political engagement make him a prominent figure in the upcoming electoral contest.Amit stated, \"We want to bring back the political beauty of Jashore, restore its lost glory, and foster personal and social coexistence. Following the downfall of the AL on August 5, BNP has consistently shown as much generosity as possible.\"He assured that all BNP leaders and activists are ready to work diligently to ensure the victory of the party's chosen nominee, under the guidance of Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman.Jamaat-e-Islami's candidate for this seat is Abdul Kader, former vice-president of Jashore Government MM College and currently a garments businessman who spends much of his time in Dhaka. Ahead of the elections, he has returned to Jashore, focusing on organizational work, public relations, and social outreach. Kader remarked, \"There has been no political practice in Jashore over the past 16 years. We are ready to restore the lost glory and rebuild Jashore, opposing divisions and conflicts.\"Other contenders include Khalid Saifullah Jewel, Central Convening Committee Member of NCP, Hafiz Abdullah of BKM, and Maulana Sowaib Hossain, Central Industry and Commerce Affairs Secretary of IAB.Khalid Saifullah Jewel said, as a son of Jashore Sadar area, he wants to contest from this seat. However, nothing can be said until the final decision is made from the party.JASHORE-4: This constituency incorporates Bagharpara and Abhoynagar upazilas along with Basundia Union of the Sadar Upazila.The parliamentary constituency is witnessing a tense battle within the BNP over party nominations for the upcoming national election.Discussions with locals reveal that the central election issue has shifted from traditional policy debates to the internal question of who will secure the BNP nomination, as the choice is considered pivotal for the constituency's political future.The rivalry is primarily between Engineer T.S. Ayub, Central Executive Committee Member of BNP and Senior Joint Secretary of the party's Central Krishak Dal, and Farazi Motiar Rahman, President of BNP's Abhaynagar Upazila unit. Both leaders are fiercely contesting to become the BNP's candidate.Although most observers see these two as the main contenders, local sources indicate that there are more layers of political manoeuvring beneath the surface. Reports suggest that the number of BNP aspirants for the nomination may increase, making it difficult to predict who will ultimately represent the party in the constituency.Meanwhile, Jamaat is closely monitoring BNP's internal conflicts and hopes to capitalise on them to gain a foothold in the constituency. Since the fall of the AL government on August 5, District Ameer of Jashore Jamaat Professor Golam Rasul has been actively touring the constituency. The party is pursuing a strategy that leverages the absence of the AL in the area, seeking to strengthen its organizational presence and influence local voters. Consequently, a unique and competitive electoral scenario is emerging in Jashore-4 well before the election day.Several other political parties have already declared their candidates for this constituency. BKM has nominated Ashiq Ilahi, while IAB has fielded Advocate Bayezid Hossain, the party's Joint General Secretary of the Central Lawyer Council. Additionally, names like Iqbal Kabir Zahid, Central General Secretary of Bangladesh Revolutionary Communist League, Advocate Zahurul Haque Zahir, Legal adviser to the Jatiya Party Chairman, and Sukriti Kumar Mondal, President of Bangladesh Minority Janata Party (BMJP), are also being discussed as potential contenders.Among the aspirants, Engineer T.S. Ayub appears to hold the edge. He previously contested the 2008 parliamentary election under the \"Sheaf of Paddy\" symbol and narrowly lost to AL candidate Ranjit Roy by just 5,000 votes. In 2018, he ran again under the same symbol but faced an electoral process widely criticised as manipulated by the AL, which hindered both him and his supporters from campaigning effectively. Despite these setbacks, Ayub has remained highly active in local politics for many years, earning him recognition across party lines. However, he now faces significant opposition from a faction within his own party.The challenge comes from Farazi Motiar Rahman, BNP's Abhaynagar Upazila President, former Central Executive Committee member, Senior Co-chairman of Nationalist Workers Party, and Vice-Chairman of the Central Textile Workers Party. Rahman has openly demanded a candidate from Abhaynagar, arguing that BNP has never fielded a nominee from this upazila since the party's establishment. He has also been mobilising local activists to support his cause, attempting to consolidate grassroots support.Another aspirant, Advocate Nure Alam Siddiqui Sohag, Joint Convener of the BNP's Dhaka Metropolitan South unit and Assistant Attorney General, has officially announced his candidacy. He made his announcement during a press interaction at a prestigious hotel in Jashore, signalling his serious intent to compete in the party's nomination race.Jamaat has been leveraging BNP's internal discord and the absence of the AL to strengthen its position. Professor Golam Rasul has actively pursued a \"boots-on-the-ground\" strategy, establishing party structures, building relationship with constituents, and offering assistance to local communities. Regular meetings with leaders and local committees, along with outreach programmes targeting various social classes, are all part of the party's carefully planned campaign.JASHORE-5: The constituency encompasses Manirampur Upazila.Locals note that this seat has witnessed communal incidents in the past, many attributed to AL affiliates. In particular, former upazila chairman and two-time MP Swapna Bhattacharya and his family allegedly exploited minority communities financially while marginalising them socially.These dynamics influenced the 2024 by-election, where a coalition of independent voters successfully supported SM Yakub Ali against the combined forces of the AL and government, suggesting potential repercussions for the upcoming elections.Observers suggest that if BNP contests alone, at least six leaders could emerge as potential candidates. However, if BNP decides to participate in a coalition, the seat may be allocated to a partner party, potentially allowing Jamaat's candidate to contest under the BNP symbol. Regardless of the scenario, Jamaat has maintained a steady organisational presence in the constituency.Among the frontrunners in the BNP nomination race is Shahid Iqbal Hossain, President of the Upazila Committee. He previously served as general secretary of the Thana Committee and has held positions as chairman of Monirampur Sadar Union and twice chairman of Monirampur Municipality.Shahid Iqbal Hossain's main rival is Mohammad Mushar, former Upazila Parishad chairman, ex-member of the District Committee, and former president of the Upazila Committee. Like Hossain, Mushar has strong grassroots connections and continues to mobilise local voters in pursuit of the nomination.Other BNP aspirants include Munir Ahmed Siddiqui Bacchu, leader of the Ershad Opposing Student Movement and son of former MP Afsar Ahmed Siddiqui; Iftikhar Selim Agni, former student leader and now central leader of the volunteer wing; and Advocate Asaduzzaman Mintu, general secretary of the Upazila BNP.The name of Mufti Abdur Rashid, Senior Joint Secretary of the central committee of Jamaat-e-Ulema Bangladesh and son of the late Mufti Muhammad Wakkas, a three-time MP from this constituency, has also emerged in discussions. With his family's long-standing political legacy, Rashid could significantly influence the nomination dynamics.Meanwhile, Jamaat maintains a strong and independent campaign strategy. Advocate Gazi Enamul Haque, a District Council Member and widely recognised poet, writer, and Islamic speaker, has been fielded as the party's candidate. He previously contested the 2014 Upazila Parishad election under challenging conditions but managed to secure significant voter support despite AL dominance. Jamaat sources indicate that the party's organisational preparations for the upcoming election are already complete, with ongoing activities strictly following the planned schedule.IAB has nominated Zainal Abedin Tipu Master, Principal Adviser of the Monirampur Upazila Committee, while Khilafat Majlis has nominated Upazila Committee President Maulana Tabibur Rahman from the seat. The National Democratic Party (Jagpa) has nominated Nizamuddin Amit, Presidium Member and District President, who also contested in 2018.JASHORE-6: This constituency covers Keshabpur Upazila.This seat consists of 11 unions and one municipality, with 217,924 registered voters. Its boundary has been redrawn multiple times, leaving a significant impact on the results of the 12 parliamentary elections held here.The constituency is witnessing early election activities as the national polls approach.While Jamaat-e-Islami appears confident with a single candidate and is preparing in full swing, BNP finds itself in disarray due to a crowded field of nomination seekers. Since the political shift of August 5, new electoral equations have emerged, particularly for this seat where long-time allies-turned-rivals BNP and Jamaat are both determined to reclaim lost ground.Observers believe that in addition to party loyalty, the personal image of the candidates will play a crucial role. The nominee who can appeal across party lines and reach the broadest section of voters is expected to hold the advantage. Local voters note that a wise nomination decision by the parties could bring them electoral dividends.Among the hopefuls are BNP's Central Assistant Secretary for Religious Affairs Amolendu Das Opu, and Keshabpur BNP President and Central Executive Committee Member Abul Hossain Azad. Apart from these two, the name of former Central Chatra Dal president and Central BNP Executive Committee Member Kazi Rawnakul Islam Shraban is also being heard.From Jamaat, Keshabpur Upazila Ameer Professor Moktar Ali has already been declared as the sole candidate. Other political parties are yet to put forward names.The fall of Hasina's government on August 5 altered the political landscape dramatically. For the first time in years, BNP and Jamaat-once coalition partners-may directly confront each other in this constituency. Both parties are now trying to expand their appeal beyond traditional bases, meaning that candidate personality and credibility could determine the outcome as much as party affiliation.With Jamaat consolidating its forces and BNP yet to resolve its candidate puzzle, the stage is set for a high-stakes showdown. The final outcome may well hinge on nomination strategy, personal credibility, and the shifting dynamics of post-August 5 politics.",

    "body": "11-party alliance led by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has announced a protest rally in Dhaka on Monday, alleging irregularities and vote rigging in 13th National Parliamentary Election, as well as incidents of post-election violence.The announcement came on Sunday following a meeting between alliance leaders and Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin at Election Commission office.The meeting began around 12:00 PM and was led by Jamaat Assistant Secretary General Hamidur Rahman Azad and Ehsanul Mahbub Jubayer.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Hamidur alleged that leaders and activists of Jamaat-led alliance had faced attacks at their homes following the election.He said the issue was formally raised with the Election Commission.In protest against the alleged attacks and electoral irregularities, the alliance will bring out a demonstration procession from Baitul Mukarram in the capital on Monday.Hamidur also claimed that voter turnout was low due to fear and intimidation.He alleged that in several polling centres, agents of the 11-party alliance were forcibly removed during vote counting.“On behalf of those of us who contested the election together, we repeatedly informed the Commission and also raised the issue at the local level. But we have not received any satisfactory action,” he said.He further alleged that irregularities during vote counting would inevitably affect the final results.According to him, several result sheets showed signs of tampering, including erasures, overwriting and alterations, and in many cases the signatures of original polling agents were not obtained.Citing an example, he claimed that in the Dhaka-6 constituency, a result sheet had been filled out in pencil.SH",

    "title": "BNP faces internal rivalry; Jamaat intensifies campaign in Rajshahi",
    "body": "RAJSHAHI, the largest city in north-western Bangladesh and the divisional headquarters of the Rajshahi Division, occupies a unique and distinguished place in the nation's history, economy, and culture. Situated on the banks of the mighty Padma River, the city is widely celebrated as the \"Silk City\" and the \"Education City\" of Bangladesh and is also enjoying international recognition as part of the country's famed mango belt.One of Rajshahi's most enduring claims to fame is its silk industry. For centuries, the region has been renowned for producing high-quality silk, often referred to simply as \"Rajshahi silk.\" This delicate, finely woven fabric has been a source of pride for generations, used in sarees, scarves, and other garments that remain popular both at home and abroad. With its soft texture, vibrant colours, and elegant designs, Rajshahi silk continues to symbolise the artistry and craftsmanship of Bangladesh's heritage textile industry.The city is also known as an academic powerhouse. Often called the \"Education City,\" Rajshahi is home to some of the country's most prestigious institutions. Rajshahi University, one of the largest and oldest universities in Bangladesh, has produced countless scholars, politicians, and intellectuals who have contributed to the nation's development. Alongside it stand other renowned institutions such as Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), Rajshahi Medical College, and Rajshahi College. Together, these institutions foster a vibrant academic environment that draws students from across the country.Rajshahi is equally celebrated for its contribution to agriculture, particularly its mango orchards. The fertile soil and favourable climate of Rajshahi and neighbouring Chapainawabganj make the region ideal for mango cultivation. These mangoes, cherished for their sweetness and flavour, not only dominate domestic markets but are also exported abroad, strengthening Bangladesh's agricultural economy and enhancing Rajshahi's reputation as part of the nation's \"mango capital.\"Adding to its appeal, the Padma River flows gracefully alongside the city, offering both natural beauty and economic lifeline.The river sustains agriculture, supports fisheries, facilitates transport, and enhances the city's scenic charm. In recent years, Rajshahi has also earned praise as one of the cleanest and most eco-friendly cities in Bangladesh. With its reduced pollution levels, greener streets, and disciplined urban management, the city stands out as an example of sustainable living in the country.As the nation prepares for the upcoming 13th Jatiya Sangsad election, Rajshahi's political climate has entered a new phase of dynamism and uncertainty. The district, comprising nine upazilas and six parliamentary constituencies, has become a focal point of shifting strategies and recalibrated ambitions. This election, scheduled for February next year, will be the first general election following the fall of the Awami League (AL) government on August 5, 2024-an event that dramatically reshaped the political order in Bangladesh.In this transformed reality, the major political parties in Rajshahi are manoeuvring to consolidate their positions. Yet, their approaches differ sharply, revealing both strengths and vulnerabilities.Once the dominant force in Rajshahi politics, the AL now appears weakened and disorganized. Following last year's political upheaval, the party's organizational structure in the district has suffered severe setbacks. Many top leaders face legal troubles, including criminal cases and imprisonment, while others remain in exile or inactive. Their absence has left a noticeable void in public activities, creating communication gaps between grassroots workers and central leadership.The lack of visible campaigning or preparatory activity has raised doubts about the party's capacity to mount a serious challenge in the upcoming polls. For now, the AL's role in Rajshahi remains uncertain, with its organizational apparatus struggling to recover from the aftershocks of losing power.In contrast, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has seized the opportunity to reinvigorate its organizational base in Rajshahi. After years of political restrictions, BNP leaders and activists are now visibly active, participating in rallies, community engagements, and cultural programmes to reconnect with voters.However, the party faces a formidable internal challenge: candidate selection. Across Rajshahi's six constituencies, nearly 50 individuals have declared themselves as aspirants for nomination. This abundance of contenders highlights both the party's renewed strength and the risk of factional rivalries. Internal competition has sparked tensions at the grassroots level, threatening party discipline and cohesion. Managing this internal contest without alienating supporters or splintering the base will be a crucial test for BNP's district leadership.Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has adopted a contrasting strategy, marked by discipline and early preparation. The party finalised its candidates for all six constituencies well ahead of its rivals, allowing nominees ample time to establish their presence.Their campaign style is less flamboyant but highly focused, relying on steady grassroots engagement, religious events, and social activities to cultivate voter loyalty.Jamaat's quiet yet organised approach has impressed observers, giving it an edge in terms of preparation even if its overall popularity faces national-level challenges.Several other parties are also active in Rajshahi. These include the Jatiya Party (JaPa), National Citizen Party (NCP), Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB), Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal (BaSaD), and Bhashani Janashakti Party. Their organizational efforts remain limited compared to BNP and Jamaat, but they are attempting to carve niches through selective programmes and targeted voter outreach.Notably, the NCP is yet to complete its district-level committees but has launched a series of initiatives to signal its presence. While their prospects of winning may be slim, smaller parties could still influence outcomes by splitting votes or aligning with larger blocs.Rajshahi thus finds itself at a political crossroads. Once defined by its silk, mangoes, and academic excellence, the city and its surrounding constituencies are now an arena where major political forces test strategies in an altered national landscape.For BNP, the challenge lies in managing internal rivalries; for Jamaat, it is sustaining disciplined growth; for AL, it is a matter of survival and relevance. Meanwhile, smaller parties watch closely, hoping to seize any opportunity created by shifts in voter loyalty.RAJSHAHI-1: This constituency covers Tanore and Godagari upazilas.The seat has a total of 440,218 registered voters.Traditionally, it has been a competitive seat, often swinging between BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, with other parties maintaining a limited footprint.The BNP faces intense competition among more than half a dozen nomination aspirants. Among the leading hopefuls is Major General (Retd.) Sharif Uddin, a member of BNP Chairperson's Advisory Committee and former military secretary to former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia (2001-2006). He is the younger brother of late minister Barrister Aminul Haque, and he has launched extensive organizational activities, leveraging both his military reputation and family legacy.Another strong contender is Advocate Sultanul Islam Tarek, a well-known industrialist who has earned a degree of grassroots acceptance through philanthropy and social work. Engineer K.M. Jewel, former environment secretary of Rajshahi City BNP, is popular among younger voters, while Barrister Mahfuzur Rahman Milon, Supreme Court lawyer and Joint Organizing Secretary of BNP's Lawyers' Forum, is drawing attention through his professional standing and his role as vice-president of Godagari BNP.Former mayor of Rajshahi City Corporation and BNP's National Executive Committee Secretary for Forest and Environment Affairs, Mosaddek Hossain Bulbul, is also seeking nomination Other BNP figures in the race include Sajedur Rahman Marconi, a veteran and former vice- president of the District BNP, and Principal Abdullah Al Mahmud Biplob, Central Assistant Secretary and Divisional Member Secretary of Zia Parishad.Jamaat has already nominated Professor Mujibur Rahman, the party's Nayeb-e-Ameer, who previously won this seat in 1986. His long-standing reputation and the party's mosque-madrasa networks continue to provide him with significant organisational strength. His campaign focuses on grassroots prayers, gatherings, and door-to-door contact.BaSaD (Khalekuzzaman faction) has confirmed its candidate, District Convener Alfaz Hossain, who is active with his party workers.JaPa leaders are also preparing, though the party is yet to declare a nominee.RAJSHAHI-2: This constituency comprises the entire Rajshahi City Corporation.The seat has a total of 318,138 registered voters.Historically, it has been a BNP stronghold, though the Workers Party and JaPa have also claimed victories in the past. Since independence, BNP has won three times, JaPa twice, and the Workers Party three times, while one independent candidate has also won.BNP has several heavyweight contenders. Mizanur Rahman Minu, a three-term mayor of Rajshahi City Corporation and member of BNP Chairperson's Advisory Council, is considered a frontrunner. He also served as MP from this seat in 2001 and remains a formidable figure in city politics. Advocate Ershad Ali Isha, Convener of Rajshahi Metropolitan BNP, is also seeking the nomination, banking on his grassroots organizational activity. Party sources say that Minu is still ahead because of his 'clean image' and experience.Jamaat has nominated Dr. Mohammad Jahangir, Nayeb-e-Ameer of Rajshahi City Jamaat and Founding Director of Islami Bank Medical College Hospital. As a physician, he enjoys a clean personal image, and his organisational base within the city's Islamic institutions makes him a strong challenger.From the left, the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) is expected to field Ragib Ahsan Munna, backed by the Left Democratic Alliance.JaPa sources confirm they will field a candidate but have not yet selected any one.RAJSHAHI-3: The constituency encompasses Mohanpur and Paba upazilas.The seat has a total of 358,663 registered voters.This constituency is another arena where BNP is struggling with multiple aspirants.Advocate Shafiqul Haque Milon, BNP's Assistant Secretary for Relief and Rehabilitation, contested here in 2018 and remains a strong candidate. Alongside him, Raihanul Alam Raihan, District BNP Convening Committee Member and former District Chhatra Dal president, is campaigning actively. Professor Abdus Samad, former Mohanpur Upazila BNP president and ex-upazila chairman, is also in the race. Nasir Hossain Osthir, son of the late state minister Advocate Kabir Hossain, carries a strong family legacy and could emerge as a serious contender.Jamaat's declared candidate is Professor Abul Kalam Azad, a five-time elected chairman of Horogram Union Parishad under Paba Upazila. His personal popularity and local service record make him a formidable force.RAJSHAHI-4: The constituency is composed of entire Bagmara Upazila.The seat has a total of 280,175 registered voters.Here, BNP faces the fiercest internal rivalry, with more than half a dozen aspirants competing. Among the contenders are D.M. Ziaur Rahman Zia, Convener of Bagmara BNP and former upazila chairman; Professor Kamal Hossain, Member Secretary of the Upazila BNP; Dr. Zahid Dewan Shamim, a U.S.-based expatriate and former Chhatra Dal leader; Dr. Ashfaqur Rahman Shelly, Central Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs of Swechchhasebak Dal; Brigadier General (Retd.) Zahurul Islam; Rezaul Karim Tutul, Secretary of District Jubo Dal; and Barrister Salekuzzaman Sagor, member of BNP's lawyers' forum.Former MP Professor Gafur and his son, retired Major Abdullah Al Farabi, are both vying for BNP's nomination in this constituency. Professor Gafur has said that the family would be satisfied if either father or son is chosen.D.M. Ziaur Rahman Zia said, \"Unhealthy competition is not good for the party. Whoever the party nominates, we will work in their favour.\"Jamaat has nominated Dr. Abdul Bari Sardar, a local leader and a physician whose long-standing service has won him widespread public acceptance. Many observers believe he could be a strong challenger to BNP.Dr. Abu Yusuf Selim, Central Secretary General of Bhasani Janashakti Party, has declared his candidacy.JaPa's Upazila Acting President Nasir Uddin is also preparing to contest.RAJSHAHI-5: The constituency encompasses Durgapur and Puthia upazilas.This seat has a total of 300,817 registered voters.In this constituency, BNP's nomination race is crowded, with at least eight hopefuls campaigning actively.A prominent contender is Abu Bakkar Siddique, Central Executive Committee Member and Convener of Puthia BNP. Another is Mahmuda Habiba, member of BNP's media cell and Joint Secretary of Krishak Dal. Professor Nazrul Islam Mondal, a former upazila chairman, is also in the fray.BNP's late MP Nadim Mostafa's son, Julkar Naeem Mostafa, carries a significant family vote bank. Mohammad Abdus Sattar, a businessman and social worker, and Golam Mostafa, former Joint Secretary of Jatiyatabadi Chatra Dal Central Committee, are also running. Two others-Rokonuazzaman Alam, a leader of Sramik Dal, and Khairul Haque Shimul, former vice-president of Puthia BNP-round out the list.Jamaat has declared District Assistant Secretary Nuruzzaman Liton as its candidate. He has begun campaigning.JaPa's former MP and freedom fighter Professor Abul Hossain, a Central Adviser, is considered a possible candidate.RAJSHAHI-6: The constituency includes Bagha and Charghat Upazilas.The seat has a total of 340,527 registered voters.This Padma riverside seat is witnessing heated BNP competition, with six aspirants vying for the nomination.Among them are Abu Sayeed Chand, Convener of Rajshahi District BNP; Nuruzzaman Manik, former president of Bagha BNP; Anwar Hossain Uzzal, former joint secretary of the District BNP and ex-president of Jubo Dal; Debashish Roy Madhu, Central Committee Member; Golam Mostafa Mamun, former District BNP organizing secretary; and Bazlur Rahman, ex-vice-president of Bagha BNP.Jamaat has declared Nazmul Haque, Assistant Secretary of District Jamaat, as its candidate.IAB has fielded Mufti Amirul Islam, President of the Malaysia branch IAB. From JaPa, District President Shamsuddin Rintu, is actively campaigning as a prospective candidate.Across Rajshahi's six constituencies, the electoral dynamics suggest that the absence of the AL will leave BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami in head-to-head competition. BNP's internal nomination rivalries present a major challenge, as factional disputes could undermine unity and voter confidence. In contrast, Jamaat's single-candidate strategy and disciplined grassroots network position it as a cohesive challenger.Smaller parties such as JaPa, BaSaD, CPB, and IAB remain in the field but are unlikely to exert significant influence, except in cases where their votes might split margins in tightly contested races.As Election Day approaches, the field will clarify further once parties officially declare their final candidates. For now, the Rajshahi electoral landscape remains one of the most competitive and strategically important in the northwest region of Bangladesh.",

    "title": "Bangla Academy goes ahead with Ekushey Book Fair amid Ramadan boycott threat",
    "body": "Boycott Threat\n\nAppeal to Tarique Rahman\n\nCall for Postponement\n\nBangladesh's premier literary event, Ekushey Book Fair, is set to open later this month amid mounting opposition from a large section of mainstream publishers who warn that holding the fair during Ramadan could inflict heavy financial losses on the industry.Bangla Academy has confirmed that the Amar Ekushey Book Fair 2026 will begin on February 20, even as more than 300 publishers have threatened to boycott the event if the schedule is not reconsidered.Dr Md Selim Reza, member secretary of the Amar Ekushey Book Fair 2026 Organising Committee, told UNB that preparations are already well underway.\"The lottery for allocation of stalls and pavilions was completed on Tuesday night. Allocation has already been finalised. Now publishers can start organising their allotted spaces,\" he said.To facilitate confirmation of stall and pavilion allotments, Bangla Academy earlier extended the payment deadline from February 9 to February 11.According to organisers, a total of 662 stalls have been allotted this year, 133 more than in 2025.Of these, 24 new publishing houses have been allocated stalls. The number of pavilions stands at 23, including 11 for established publishing houses and 12 for new ones.However, the decision to hold the 23-day fair from February 20 - during the fasting month of Ramadan - has triggered strong objections from publishers.In a press release signed by Mazharul Islam of Anyaprokash, a group of publishers said at least 321 publishing houses had demanded that the fair be held after Ramadan and would stay away if the schedule remained unchanged.Several publishers said they had raised concerns well in advance but received no positive response from the authorities.They argue that Ramadan typically brings shorter working hours and reduced consumer spending during daytime, which could significantly affect book sales. Many fear that participating under such conditions would result in substantial losses.In a further escalation, the publishers' platform Prokashok Oikk (Publishers' Unity) has sent an open letter to Tarique Rahman, chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the next Prime Minister of Bangladesh, seeking intervention.In the letter, the platform said nearly 90% of publishers believe that taking part in the fair during Ramadan would amount to 'commercial suicide'. It claimed that more than 300 mainstream publishers have already expressed their inability to participate.The publishers said the industry has been under severe strain for the past one and a half years due to political and economic instability. Rising paper prices and increased production costs have intensified financial pressure, they said.They also noted that printing presses had remained largely preoccupied with election-related work over the past two months, effectively halting the publication of new titles.Against this backdrop, the publishers questioned why Bangla Academy remains firm on holding the fair despite repeated appeals for reconsideration.The publishers stressed that they are not opposed to the book fair itself. Instead, they said they want a 'successful and inclusive' event that upholds the spirit and tradition of Amar Ekushey.Considering Ramadan and the post-election situation, they proposed holding the fair after Eid.In their letter, they placed two key demands before the new government led by Tarique Rahman: first, postponement of the fair scheduled to begin on 20 February; and second, organising the event in a festive and full-fledged manner after Eid.They expressed hope that a positive decision would protect the publishing industry from major losses and help preserve the legacy of the Amar Ekushey Book Fair - a cultural fixture that commemorates the Language Movement and remains one of the country's most anticipated literary gatherings.For now, however, the fair appears set to go ahead as planned, setting the stage for a confrontation between organisers determined to maintain tradition and publishers wary of the economic realities they face.",

    "body": "Speaking at a post-election briefing in Dhaka on Saturday, European Union Election Observation Mission head Ivars Ijabs, EU observers did not witness manipulation at polling stations they monitored across the country.\n\n“I can state responsibly that we did not directly observe fraud or ballot stuffing,” said Ijabs, who is also a member of the European Parliament, responding to questions about allegations raised in certain constituencies. He acknowledged that observers noted some procedural irregularities but said these did not amount to proof of systematic interference in the vote.\n\nIjabs stressed that any complaints related to individual seats should be addressed through established legal channels. The European Union (EU) has assessed the national parliamentary election as genuinely competitive and broadly transparent, with its chief observer saying monitors found no direct evidence of ballot stuffing or organised fraud.Speaking at a post-election briefing in Dhaka on Saturday, European Union Election Observation Mission head Ivars Ijabs, EU observers did not witness manipulation at polling stations they monitored across the country.“I can state responsibly that we did not directly observe fraud or ballot stuffing,” said Ijabs, who is also a member of the European Parliament, responding to questions about allegations raised in certain constituencies. He acknowledged that observers noted some procedural irregularities but said these did not amount to proof of systematic interference in the vote.Ijabs stressed that any complaints related to individual seats should be addressed through established legal channels.\n\nHe urged the authorities to ensure that objections, appeals and post-election disputes are handled in a transparent and timely manner to maintain public confidence.\n\nCommenting on voter turnout, the EU chief observer said participation should not be judged solely by percentages. “Turnout figures alone do not define democratic quality,” he said, adding that the key issue is whether all segments of society are able to take part freely and without exclusion.\n\nDescribing the election as competitive, he noted that around 2,000 candidates contested the polls, giving voters a wide range of choices.\n\nThe mission’s role, he said, was to assess the process as a whole rather than certify results.\n\nIjabs highlighted women’s political participation as an area requiring urgent attention, pointing out that women made up only about four percent of the candidates.\n\nEmphasising civic equality as a core democratic principle, he called for stronger efforts to improve women’s representation in line with international commitments.\n\nOn minority participation, he said EU observers met representatives of indigenous, religious and ethnic communities during field visits. While no widespread targeting of minorities was observed on election day itself, some communities voiced lingering concerns based on past experiences. Building trust and inclusion, he said, would require sustained effort beyond a single election.\n\nThe EU mission also gave a generally positive assessment of the Election Commission’s logistical preparations, citing orderly polling procedures and transparency in areas such as candidate registration. Given the scale of the election, the Commission’s overall performance left a favourable impression, the chief observer said.\n\nAddressing the media environment, Ijabs described Bangladesh’s press landscape as diverse but warned that misinformation, including AI-generated content, poses growing challenges for democracies worldwide and requires continued vigilance.\n\nHe welcomed what he described as a willingness among major political actors to maintain calm following the vote, despite reports of isolated tensions. “Political responsibility does not end on polling day,” he said, urging all sides to avoid violence and rely on lawful mechanisms to resolve disputes.\n\nThe EU mission has been in Bangladesh since late December 2025 and observed voting in 805 polling centres across all 64 districts. It will remain in the country until early March to follow post-election developments, including the handling of complaints. A detailed final report with findings and recommendations is expected in late April or early May.",

    "body": "The 11-party alliance has claimed that the people of Bangladesh have delivered a clear mandate in favour of allocating 100 seats in the proposed upper house of parliament in proportion to vote share, following the outcome of the recent referendum.Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the alliance on Saturday (February 14), the alliance spokesperson Hamidur Rahman Azad said the overwhelming victory of the “Yes” vote reflected the public’s decisive verdict on the issue.He said that since the “Yes” option had won by a large margin, any note of dissent now carried no political or moral weight. “Any attempt to undermine this outcome would amount to disregarding the people’s verdict,” he warned, urging all quarters to refrain from such moves.Azad also cautioned that if attacks and violence against political activists continued, the alliance would be compelled to take to the streets. He said Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami would confront such situations through political means, stressing that the alliance would not remain passive in the face of intimidation.According to the spokesperson, the 11-party alliance will continue to work jointly, both inside and outside parliament, in the national interest. He said Jamaat-e-Islami would play a responsible role in parliament, while the alliance as a whole would pursue political movements over issues that remain unresolved through parliamentary processes.Azad further alleged irregularities in the post-election process, claiming that in constituencies where candidates lost by narrow margins, demands for recounts were ignored by the Bangladesh Election Commission. Instead, he said, gazette notifications were issued hastily overnight.He added that preparations were under way to file writ petitions with the High Court Division seeking recounts in those constituencies, arguing that transparency and fairness required a fresh review of the disputed results.The alliance reiterated that it would continue to pursue its demands through constitutional and legal avenues while remaining prepared for political action if the people’s mandate was, in its view, disregarded.",

    "body": "The International Republican Institute (IRI) has described Bangladesh’s February 12 parliamentary elections as a key milestone in the country’s ongoing democratic transition.“Security forces and the Election Commission performed admirably. After years of authoritarian rule, Election Day was mostly peaceful and incident-free. Given the historical context, that is a big step forward for Bangladesh,” said former US congressman David Dreier, who headed the IRI observer delegation.In a statement, IRI said it deployed a high-level international delegation to Dhaka from 9 to 13 February to evaluate the conduct of 2026 elections.According to its preliminary findings, the delegation described the polls as “an inflection point” as Bangladesh navigates a complex democratic transition following the July 2024 uprising that brought an end to more than 15 years of rule by Awami League.While the delegation found the technical administration of the election to be sound, it noted that the broader political environment remains fragile and urged candidates and political actors to resolve disputes through legal means.The report stated that the pre-election period was comparatively peaceful, although clashes were reported in several districts.Voter turnout reached 59 percent, with notable participation from first-time voters, particularly those under the age of 35.The Election Commission was commended for its logistical preparedness, operational transparency and reforms, including the introduction of postal voting for expatriates, updated accreditation criteria for citizen observers and a nationwide voter education campaign.However, the delegation observed the underrepresentation of women and members of ethnic and religious minorities among candidates, though it found no evidence of widespread targeting of minority communities on Election Day.Voting generally began on schedule, with adequate materials available and the counting process was described as transparent and efficient. Layered security measures were credited with containing isolated incidents.IRI said it will continue to monitor the post-election environment and will publish a final report offering detailed analysis and recommendations.SH",

An important part of the foreign policy of Tarique Rahman… Making this region an influential region. Sense of priority in sending out invitations for the inauguration,” he said.He added that the invitation is a goodwill gesture aimed at improving bilateral relations. “You give an invitation for people to attend, you will have expectations that you attend. A goodwill gesture,” Kabir said.The new government also intends to pursue a balanced approach to regional cooperation, he noted, highlighting multilateral platforms such as South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) as key avenues for engagement.The announcement comes amid a wave of international congratulations following BNP’s decisive victory in the 12 February elections, marking a major political shift after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government on August 5, 2024.Prime Minister Modi has already reached out to Tarique Rahman via phone, congratulating him on “remarkable victory” and expressing India’s support for a democratic and progressive Bangladesh.SH",

    "body": "Professor Ali Riaz, Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser, has said that the citizens of Bangladesh have expressed their verdict clearly and unequivocally in favour of the constitutional reform proposals outlined in the July National Charter.This verdict, he noted, makes it evident that the majority of Bangladeshis do not wish to return to the previous system or maintain the status quo. They seek change and reform of the state structure.He made these remarks at a briefing held on Saturday morning at the auditorium of the Foreign Service Academy.Quoting from Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus’s address to the nation ahead of the referendum, Ali Riaz said: “A national transformation can never be sustainable if it is achieved through unilateral decisions or single-party rule. The people are the true source of the state’s strength. The ultimate legitimacy of change derives from the consent of the people. Therefore, providing citizens with the opportunity to take direct decisions in determining the country’s future direction is the cornerstone of the democratic path.”“With this objective in mind, we organised the referendum so that the people could directly express their views on the future course of national reforms. The public responded to my call. The verdict has come in favour of reform,” he added.Ali Riaz said the outcome of the referendum should not be viewed merely in numerical terms.“This verdict is an acknowledgement of the responsibility entrusted to us by those who sacrificed their lives, those who were injured and those who fought fearlessly during the July–August mass uprising of 2024. It represents the people’s commitment to fulfilling the duty they have assigned to us.”He continued: “The referendum reflects the public aspiration to establish institutional structures to ensure that the rivers of martyrs’ blood, mothers’ tears and the cries of the oppressed witnessed over nearly 16 years are never repeated. The will expressed by the sovereign people in 2024 has once again been reaffirmed through this referendum. We have no opportunity to forget these matters.”Ali Riaz further said that the clear popular mandate for reform expressed through the referendum places responsibility upon the political parties to implement it. He noted that all political parties are committed to state reform. “We call upon the ruling party, the parties represented in the National Parliament and the Constitutional Reform Council, as well as those outside Parliament, to ensure, through dialogue and unity, the implementation of this popular mandate,” he said.NSA",

    "body": "Bangladesh's leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces \"huge\" challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government, reports AFP.If victorious on Thursday, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said his first priority would be restoring security to end the political turmoil that has gripped the country since the overthrow of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic rule by a 2024 youth-led uprising.\"We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,\" Rahman told AFP.But he warned the task ahead in the South Asian nation of 170 million people would be daunting.\"The economy has been destroyed,\" he said, accusing the ousted government of neglecting ordinary citizens.\"The health system has been destroyed in the last regime, the energy sector has been destroyed\".Rahman's BNP is a frontrunner in the polls, but faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party.Soft-spoken Rahman, sitting in his office underneath gold-framed portraits of his late parents -- former Bangladesh leaders Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia -- said he was confident of a decisive victory.\"We expect that we will have a clear mandate from the people -- a big mandate,\" he said, adding he did not foresee the need for a coalition beyond his current party alliance.\"We'll have enough seats to form our own government.\"'Try to do better'Rahman, 60, returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain during Hasina's rule.He assumed the leadership of the BNP from his mother, three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December aged 80, just days after he returned.\"They were they, I am me,\" he said, referring to his famous parents, but stressing he too had spent a lifetime in politics. \"I will try to do better than them.\"Among the top of the list of tasks he will face if elected will be to tackle the economic woes of the world's second-largest producer of garments.\"There are serious challenges ahead of us -- we need to tackle the economic situation,\" he added.\"There are a huge number of unemployed. We need to create businesses for these young people to have jobs,\" he said, adding he was particularly worried about the economic situation faced by women.'Neighbourly relationship'With relations between Bangladesh and neighbouring India strained, Rahman struck a careful note on foreign ties.\"The interest of my people, and the interest of my country, comes first,\" he said, but adding that Bangladesh nevertheless wanted \"at least a neighbourly relationship\" with the countries surrounding it.Hasina, 78, is currently in hiding in India and was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity in November.She was once praised for overseeing Bangladesh's rapid economic rise, but she also presided over a government that crushed dissent and is accused of rampant theft, especially from large-scale public infrastructure projects.\"What we see is that in the name of mega projects, mega corruption has taken place,\" said Rahman.\"A few people were made very rich. But the rest of the country, the whole population, they were left with nothing.\"But Rahman said he opposed banning political parties by law.Bangladesh's interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has barred Hasina's Awami League from contesting the vote.\"Of course, if someone is involved in some kind of crime, they need to be punished as per the law,\" he said.",

    "body": "The 13th Jatiya Sangsad Election and referendum in Bangladesh have attracted widespread international media coverage, with major outlets highlighting the historic vote throughout the day.Prominent platforms such as The Guardian, BBC, Al Jazeera, The Hindu and others carried live updates and analyses, making it a headline story globally.Reuters described the event as “Voters in long lines in first election after Sheikh Hasina’s ouster,” calling the vote “groundbreaking” in the context of Bangladesh’s recent political turmoil.The report highlighted that the election follows a period of unrest sparked by controversial job quotas under Sheikh Hasina’s administration, which led to 2024 student-led protests. Hundreds were killed and thousands injured during clashes with security forces, ultimately prompting Hasina’s resignation and departure to India.The article noted that Generation Z voters were motivated by issues such as employment, anti-corruption measures and political accountability.The New York Times emphasized that over 120 million citizens participated in choosing new leadership, describing it as a pivotal moment for the country.The report noted that many Bangladeshis view this vote as an opportunity to establish an inclusive democracy with safeguards against widespread corruption and authoritarianism.BBC’s live coverage highlighted that this election marked the country’s first polls after 2024 mass uprising, which ended Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, during which 1,400 protesters were killed. Awami League was barred from contesting and allegations of state repression during the unrest were noted, though Hasina denied them.The Guardian framed the election as signaling “a new era of clean politics under Tarique Rahman,” who returned to Bangladesh from London after 17 years of exile to contest as the main opposition leader, pledging to end corruption and lead the country on a “new path.”Al Jazeera emphasized that the vote would not only determine the next government but also decide the future of reforms through referendum, highlighting the main contenders: BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami’s Dr. Shafiqur Rahman.Geo News of Pakistan described the vote as “historic following 2024 uprising,” noting long queues and an intense electoral contest.Indian media also covered the election extensively. The Hindu reported a competitive race between BNP and Jamaat, with BNP slightly ahead, citing a 32 percent voter turnout by midday.The Times of India highlighted isolated clashes and unrest in some areas.The international coverage underscores global attention on Bangladesh’s democratic transition, marking the election as a crucial step in the nation’s political and reform-oriented future.SH",

    "body": "For years under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s opposition had little presence on the streets during elections, either boycotting polls or being sidelined by mass arrests of senior leaders. Now, ahead of Thursday’s vote, the roles have reversed.Hasina’s Awami League is banned, but many young people who helped oust her government in a 2024 uprising say the upcoming vote will be the Muslim-majority nation's first competitive election since 2009, when she began a 15-year-rule, reports Reuters.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely expected to win, although a coalition led by Jamaat-e-Islami is putting up a strong challenge. A new party driven by Gen-Z activists under the age of 30 has aligned with Jamaat after failing to translate its anti-Hasina street mobilisation into an electoral base.BNP chief Tarique Rahman told Reuters his party, which is contesting 292 of the 300 parliamentary seats at stake, was confident of winning \"enough to form a government\".Analysts say a decisive result in the February 12 vote, instead of a fractured outcome, is vital for restoring stability in the nation of 175 million after Hasina's ouster triggered months of unrest and disrupted major industries, including the garments sector in the world’s second‑largest exporter.The verdict will also affect the roles of rival regional heavyweights China and India in the South Asian nation.\"Opinion polls suggest the BNP has an edge, but we must remember that a significant portion of voters are still undecided,\" said Parvez Karim Abbasi, executive director at Dhaka's Centre for Governance Studies.\"Several factors will shape the outcome, including how Generation Z - which makes up about a quarter of the electorate - votes, as their choices will carry considerable weight.\"Across Bangladesh, black‑and‑white posters and banners bearing the BNP’s “sheaf of paddy” symbol and Jamaat’s “scales” hang from poles and trees and are pasted on roadside walls, alongside those of several independent candidates. Party shacks on street corners, draped in their emblems, blare campaign songs.It marks a sharp contrast with past elections, when the Awami League’s \"boat\" symbol dominated the landscape.Opinion polls expect the once-banned Jamaat to have its best electoral performance even if it does not win.CHINA'S INFLUENCE INCREASES AS INDIA'S WANESThe election verdict will also influence the roles of China and India in Bangladesh in coming years, analysts have said. Beijing has increased its standing in Bangladesh since Hasina was seen as pro-India and fled to New Delhi after her ouster, where she remains.While New Delhi's influence is on the wane, the BNP is seen by some analysts as being relatively more in tune with India than the Jamaat.A Jamaat-led government might tilt closer to Pakistan, a fellow Muslim‑majority nation and a long‑standing rival of Hindu‑majority India, analysts say. Also, Jamaat's Gen-Z ally has said \"New Delhi’s hegemony\" in Bangladesh is one of its main concerns and its leaders met Chinese diplomats recently.Jamaat, which calls for a society governed by Islamic principles, has said the party is not inclined towards any country.BNP's Rahman has said if his party formed the government it would have friendly relations with any nation that \"offers what is suitable for my people and my country\".Bangladesh, one of the world’s most densely populated countries with high rates of extreme poverty, has been hit by high inflation, weakening reserves and slowing investment, which has pushed it to seek large-scale external financing since 2022, including billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.Corruption is the biggest concern among the 128 million voters, followed by inflation, according to a survey by Dhaka-based think tanks Communication & Research Foundation and Bangladesh Election and Public Opinion Studies.Analysts say Jamaat's clean image is a factor in its favour, much more than its Islamic leanings.\"Voters report high intention to participate, prioritise corruption and economic concerns over religious or symbolic issues, and express clear expectations for leaders who demonstrate care, competence and accountability,\" said the survey.Nevertheless, BNP's Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is seen as the frontrunner to lead the next government. But if the Jamaat-led coalition emerges ahead, its chair, Shafiqur Rahman, could be in line for the top job.Mohammad Rakib, 21, who is set to vote for the first time, said he hoped the next government would allow people to express their views and exercise their franchise freely.\"Everyone was tired of (Hasina's) Awami League. People couldn’t even vote during national elections. People had no voice,\" he said. \"I hope the next government, whoever comes into power, will ensure this freedom of expression.\"",

    "title": "A Fragile Dawn: Country go to polls deciding a new political future",
    "body": "Today, Bangladesh stands at a rare and defining moment in its political history. The country’s 13th parliamentary elections today arrive at a moment- heavy, perhaps too heavy with history, possibilities and challenges – all three together.Coming after the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina–led regime on 5 August 2024, this election is more than a routine constitutional exercise. It is a reckoning with the country’s recent past and a collective attempt to reset the moral, institutional, and democratic compass of the state. For many Bangladeshis, it feels like the closing of a long, suffocating chapter—and also a manifestly fragile opening of a new one.For over a decade and half, Bangladesh’s democratic architecture steadily eroded under an increasingly centralized and authoritarian style of political governance. In the due course, national elections held in 2014, 18 and 24 lost credibility while institutions were hollowed out. Political dissent was criminalized, and political competition narrowed to the point of near extinction.While the Awami League justified its grip on power in the name of stability, development, and secularism, the costs were borne by democratic norms: compromised courts, politicized bureaucracy, constrained media followed by a culture of fear that seeped into everyday civic life. The collapse of that regime, however it is interpreted, has created a rare political rupture—one that offers space for renewal but also carries the risk of relapse.This election is crucial because it represents a chance to restore the most basic democratic principle: Rights of citizens to choose their leaders freely and meaningfully. A credible, competitive, and participatory election can begin to heal public trust that has been badly damaged by years of disputed polls and one-sided contests.However, the political trust, once broken, is not easily rebuilt. It requires not only transparent voting procedures but also a visible commitment by all political actors to accept rules of the game, respect outcomes, and place the national interest above partisan gain.It is equally important to note that - the 13th JS polls offer a unique opportunity to decisively shun authoritarian political practices that had somewhat become normalized.Let us not forget that rampant use of state machineries against political opposition, blurring the lines between party and government, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, and silencing of journalists and activists must be confronted not as excesses of one political regime only - but as structural failures that allowed power to concentrate unchecked.While the nation is heading for the ballots today, democracy cannot be restored merely by changing the occupants of office, it must be safeguarded by rebuilding severely damaged institutions that can detain and hold accountable whoever governs next.Against the backdrop of today’s Bangladesh’s reality, we comprehend today’s national elections as the beginning of a new chapter in Bangladesh’s political journey. And a new chapter does not mean forgetting the past, but drawing lessons from past mistakes and failures.It calls for a political culture that values pluralism over dominance, accountability over impunity, and dialogue over coercion. Most important - it demands to move away from zero-sum politics, where victory means total control and defeat means exclusion, and march toward a system where opposition is seen as legitimate and necessary.What do we, as a responsible media house expect from the party that wins today’s elections?First and foremost, restraint. After years of apparent oppression and a failed interim arrangement, we expect an elected government that governs within limits—constitutional, legal and ethical – on all three counts.The winning party must resist the temptation to weaponize the state against rivals or to perpetuate the same tools of repression it may once have suffered under.Since democracy is to take root again, breaking the cycle of vengeance and payback politics is essential.We along with all Bangladeshis expect protection of fundamental rights. That said- freedom of expression, media independence, academic freedom, and the right to peaceful protests are not luxuries, but the lifeblood of a democratic society. A government confident in its mandate should not fear criticism, on the contrary, it should welcome it as a corrective force.Going beyond democracy, people want dignity in governance, meaning tackling corruption seriously, ensuring fair access to justice, addressing economic inequality, and creating opportunities—especially for youth—based on merit rather than political loyalty.A polite reminder to all our 51 political parties today - development that silence voices is no longer enough - citizens crave for development that empowers them.Finally, there is a deep desire for inclusivity.Bangladesh is diverse in opinions, identities and aspirations. The next government must speak to all of them, and not just merely focus on its electoral base. National unity cannot be enforced - it must be earned through fairness, empathy, and shared purpose.Today’s 13th parliamentary elections, therefore, is not just about which party wins it, but about how power is exercised afterward. It is a test of whether Bangladesh can move beyond a history of democratic backsliding and seize this rare moment to build a more open, transparent, accountable, and humane political order.The stakes are high—but so is our hope.",

    "body": "In a move that has stunned fans and rattled Bollywood’s music ecosystem, Arijit Singh has announced that he is stepping away from playback singing, effectively drawing the curtain on one of the most dominant eras in Indian film music.The announcement came quietly but decisively at the start of 2026 through a text-only post on Instagram. After wishing his followers a Happy New Year, Singh revealed that he would no longer be taking on any new assignments as a playback vocalist. “I am calling it off,” he wrote, describing his journey as a “wonderful” one, brief words that carried enormous weight.While the message sounded final, it does not signal a complete exit from music. Singh is expected to honour all his existing commitments and complete songs already in the pipeline. However, going forward, he plans to shift his creative focus away from mainstream cinema. According to reports, the singer wants to explore independent music and work on his own terms, describing his future self as “a small little artist,” free from the pressures of the commercial film industry.The reaction from fans has been immediate and emotional. Social media platforms are awash with tributes, playlists, and memories of his countless chart-toppers, with many calling it a heartbreaking and ominous start to 2026 for Bollywood music. Industry watchers are also grappling with the implications, acknowledging the void his absence will create in film soundtracks.As the shock settles in, one thing is already clear. Whether in films or beyond them, Arijit Singh’s voice has shaped a generation, and Bollywood will never quite sound the same again.",

    "title": "A Jamaat Candidate, a Gunman, and a Whole Lot of Drama!!!",
    "body": "Photo: AI generated\n\nLate last Tuesday, a viral video clip took me by storm.\n\nThe writer is Editorial Chief, The Daily Observer\n\nIt is a 7-minute and 36-second long somewhat a spectacle featuring SM Khaliduzzaman, the Jamaat-e-Islami candidate for Dhaka-17, engaging in a heated showdown with an army personnel member.The scene unfolded at the entrance of the Dhaka cantonment area, where the Jamaat candidate, accompanied by a gunman was denied entry due to the cantonment area’s security protocol rules. Though the Jamaat candidate was repeatedly assured of army security without his gunman within the cantonment area, his headstrong ego refused to budge.It is perhaps his personal gunman is more committed safeguarding his life compared to members of a disciplined regular force or his gun is more lethal to our army’s automatic weapons.To cut a long story short – the Jamaat candidate’s verbal fireworks were nothing short of a political soap opera.The showdown picture, as captured in the clip shownthe candidate - all fired up, hurling accusations at the military, as if they were pinatas at a birthday party. The army personnel, displaying remarkable patience, repeatedly explained the cantonment area’s travel restrictions, but MrKhaliduzzaman, bless his head and heart, was on a roll, launching verbal grenades at the poor military personnel.In the beginning, he accused them of “favouritism” towards certain political leaders.And just when you think it couldn’t get any more dramatic, the Jamaat candidateturns full Shakespearean, exclaiming, “In Tarique Zia's case, you clean the roads with your tongue, so why can't he go?”As if on the night before he had discovered a secret club where the army members sip tea with Mr Tarique Rahman while jointly plan to block travel routes of his political rivals.I wish, if I could only have such a bombastic political flair while struck in Dhaka’s rude traffic awakenings, and particularly as a resident of Dhaka-17 constituency.Here I am, gearing up to cast my vote on February 12 with my mother, and suddenly our options look like aTV reality show gone completely wrong.The Jamaat candidate’s rude and comicalreactions left me baffled. Is this really the type of leadership we are preparing to elect as public representatives?Watching him in the video clip was like witnessing a melodrama unfold, complete with dramatic gestures and postures that would make a soap opera star proud.A candidate who explodes with all-out anger over a logical security protocol through a sensitive military zone, at one point it appeared as if he had been deliberately cheated in a game of Monopoly.The million-dollar question: If this is how MrKhaliduzzaman reacts to a travel restriction in a cantonment area, how would he treat his subjects, if he actually wins?Perhaps he would demand a red carpet for all occasions and his political activities—complete with marching bands and confetti.After watching the full video clip twice, I couldn’t help but delete his name from my preferred candidates list without a second thought.A constituency as significant as Dhaka-17, can ill-afford to elect a politician who seems to have missed the memo on decorum.The Jamaat leader’s uncalled-for incident serves as an eye-opening lesson in the country’s political civility.Voters want leaders who can handle pressure with grace, not candidates who resort to name-calling and accusations like a child in a playground scuffle.In a country where political campaigning and discourses often resembles a circus, we need representatives who can rise above the fray. A little respect undeniably goes a long way, particularly dealing with the very institution responsible for safeguarding our independence, sovereignty and help maintain order in our society.Let us all reflect once more to this aforementioned incident, and remind ourselves that a political leader’s ability to engage in a civil discourseis equally important as any campaign promise.If a candidate can’t even handle a simple checkpoint security protocol without blowing a gasket, how can we trust him with vital responsibilities of public office?So, as I prepare to cast my vote, I am looking for someone who can not only navigate the political landscape,but also do so with respect and responsibility.To finish with, in the upcoming elections, I am expecting to see a caring and conscious public representative in my constituency, not a disruptive and a melodramatic side actor.If you feel as baffled as I do, let’s raise a toast to choosing matured and mindful candidates—hoping the next political drama is a little less chaotic.",

    "body": "Karan has commented on the box office success of Bollywood films like Dhurandhar and Border 2\n\nFilmmaker Karan Johar on Sunday declared that Bollywood has made a strong comeback, citing the back-to-back box office success of Ranveer Singh-starrer Dhurandhar and the war drama Border 2.Sharing his reaction on Instagram, Johar said the recent commercial performance of the two films had reaffirmed the long-term strength of the Hindi film industry, dismissing critics who had questioned its future.Referring to the strong audience response, Johar said emotionally driven films were once again connecting with cinema-goers, adding that such successes proved Bollywood’s resilience and relevance.His remarks came as Border 2 recorded one of the biggest openings in recent years and moved steadily towards the Rs 100 crore mark at the domestic box office. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh said the film earned Rs 32.10 crore net in India on its opening day, performing strongly in mass belts and single-screen theatres, while urban centres saw improved turnout later in the day.Although heavy rainfall affected collections in parts of north India, industry observers expect strong word of mouth and the Republic Day holiday to further boost earnings.Directed by Anurag Singh, Border 2 was released on January 23 and features Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan, Diljit Dosanjh and Ahan Shetty in lead roles.Meanwhile, Dhurandhar, starring Ranveer Singh and Akshaye Khanna, recently completed 50 days in theatres. Despite stiff competition from new releases, the Aditya Dhar-directed film emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time, surpassing Pushpa 2: The Rule. The film is planned as a two-part franchise, with its sequel scheduled for release on March 19, 2026.",

    "body": "The writer is an art critic and cultural curator.\n\nOn a rainy day in 2004, the late sculptor Syed Abdullah Khalid took me to an architectural firm located at the Bangla Motor in the city. This was my first encounter with the distinguished socio-cultural activist, art critic, and architect, Professor Shamsul Wares. Following our introduction, I perceived him as a person of considerable intellect and logical reasoning, genuinely secular and a deep thinker. His passion and introverted nature led me to notice how he consistently avoided human distractions, publicity, media attention, and the pursuit of fame. Wares possesses exceptional analytical abilities and has a tendency to articulate his preferences clearly.Despite being a staunch atheist, Wares advocates for equal rights for individuals of all faiths. He has consistently spoken out against social injustice, inequality, inhumanity, religious intolerance, and illegal actions.My perception of him has consistently been that of an individual who cherishes life and has a deep appreciation for art, literature, music, photography, and cinema. The specifics of Shamsul Wares' daily activities will naturally fluctuate, depending on the season. Nevertheless, most of his days are likely to include many, if not all, of the following activities—teaching, enjoying films, engaging in academic reading, writing creatively, reflecting on various topics, participating in interviews, and contributing to meetings, seminars, conferences, and workshops as a senior academic and one of Bangladesh's prominent multidimensional figures. Despite nearing eighty years of age, he shows no signs of diminishing energy.Wares has a strong aversion to pretentiousness, and his articles and presentations lack any form of exaggeration. Upon examining his writings, one can observe that they are predominantly precise, reflective, and contemplative. He is candid and courageous in articulating the truth.Shamsul Wares stands as one of the most distinguished figures in the realm of contemporary architecture in Bangladesh. Additionally, he is a prominent art critic, social and cultural activist. His innovative and refreshing perspective on architecture sets him apart in our nation. His buildings are recognised for their modern aesthetic and a tendency towards experimentalism. Common characteristics of his architectural designs include unobstructed views and the effortless flow of air and light. Most importantly, his creations embody a modern essence and possess a harmonious quality. He adopts a balanced and logical approach to spatial utilisation.January 21 commemorates the 80th anniversary of Professor Wares' birth. He served as a professor in the Architecture Department at the Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (BUET). Although naturally reserved, he emerged as a vocal liberal intellectual during the 1990s, opposing reactionary nationalism and religious fundamentalism in Bangladesh. He is recognised as one of the leading architects of the 1970s, a period characterised by significant achievements and innovative ideas. In terms of content, material, form, and shape, he can be regarded as a modern architect.Wares has designed many residential, institutional and public buildings. Outside his freelancing career, he served as president of The Institute of Architects, Bangladesh (IAB) for two terms and has led the Bangladesh delegation at five ARCASIA meetings. He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Architectural Education by IAB in 2009.Wares has attended as juror and speaker in many seminars, art and architecture exhibitions, competitions, architecture biennial and triennials in our country and abroad.

    "title": "Bangla Academy goes ahead with Ekushey Book Fair amid Ramadan boycott threat",
    "body": "Bangladesh’s premier literary event, Ekushey Book Fair, is set to open later this month amid mounting opposition from a large section of mainstream publishers who warn that holding the fair during Ramadan could inflict heavy financial losses on the industry.\n\nBangla Academy has confirmed that the Amar Ekushey Book Fair 2026 will begin on February 20, even as more than 300 publishers have threatened to boycott the event if the schedule is not reconsidered.\n\nDr Md Selim Reza, member secretary of the Amar Ekushey Book Fair 2026 Organising Committee, told UNB that preparations are already well underway.\n\n“The lottery for allocation of stalls and pavilions was completed on Tuesday night. Allocation has already been finalised. Now publishers can start organising their allotted spaces,” he said.\n\nTo facilitate confirmation of stall and pavilion allotments, Bangla Academy earlier extended the payment deadline from February 9 to February 11.\n\nAccording to organisers, a total of 662 stalls have been allotted this year, 133 more than in 2025.\n\nOf these, 24 new publishing houses have been allocated stalls. The number of pavilions stands at 23, including 11 for established publishing houses and 12 for new ones.\n\nBoycott Threat\n\nHowever, the decision to hold the 23-day fair from February 20 — during the fasting month of Ramadan — has triggered strong objections from publishers.\n\nIn a press release signed by Mazharul Islam of Anyaprokash, a group of publishers said at least 321 publishing houses had demanded that the fair be held after Ramadan and would stay away if the schedule remained unchanged.\n\nSeveral publishers said they had raised concerns well in advance but received no positive response from the authorities.\n\nThey argue that Ramadan typically brings shorter working hours and reduced consumer spending during daytime, which could significantly affect book sales. Many fear that participating under such conditions would result in substantial losses.\n\nAppeal to Tarique Rahman\n\nIn a further escalation, the publishers’ platform Prokashok Oikk (Publishers’ Unity) has sent an open letter to Tarique Rahman, chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the next Prime Minister of Bangladesh, seeking intervention.\n\nIn the letter, the platform said nearly 90% of publishers believe that taking part in the fair during Ramadan would amount to ‘commercial suicide’. It claimed that more than 300 mainstream publishers have already expressed their inability to participate.\n\nThe publishers said the industry has been under severe strain for the past one and a half years due to political and economic instability. Rising paper prices and increased production costs have intensified financial pressure, they said.\n\nThey also noted that printing presses had remained largely preoccupied with election-related work over the past two months, effectively halting the publication of new titles.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the publishers questioned why Bangla Academy remains firm on holding the fair despite repeated appeals for reconsideration.\n\nCall for Postponement\n\nThe publishers stressed that they are not opposed to the book fair itself. Instead, they said they want a ‘successful and inclusive’ event that upholds the spirit and tradition of Amar Ekushey.\n\nConsidering Ramadan and the post-election situation, they proposed holding the fair after Eid.\n\nIn their letter, they placed two key demands before the new government led by Tarique Rahman: first, postponement of the fair scheduled to begin on 20 February; and second, organising the event in a festive and full-fledged manner after Eid.\n\nThey expressed hope that a positive decision would protect the publishing industry from major losses and help preserve the legacy of the Amar Ekushey Book Fair — a cultural fixture that commemorates the Language Movement and remains one of the country’s most anticipated literary gatherings.\n\nFor now, however, the fair appears set to go ahead as planned, setting the stage for a confrontation between organisers determined to maintain tradition and publishers wary of the economic realities they face.",

    "body": "Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with gross corruption over his links to convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Norwegian police said.\n\nThe charge was filed after the Council of Europe lifted Jagland’s diplomatic immunity, which he held due to his former role as secretary general of the organisation. His lawyer said Jagland denies criminal liability and is ready to cooperate with investigators.\n\nNorway’s economic crime unit Økokrim has searched three of Jagland’s properties and is expected to question him as part of the investigation.\n\nAuthorities launched the probe earlier this month into alleged acts of gross corruption said to have taken place between 2011 and 2018, during Jagland’s tenure at the Council of Europe.\n\nDocuments released by the US Department of Justice, often referred to as the Epstein files, suggest Epstein may have covered travel expenses for Jagland and his family to visit properties in Paris, New York and Palm Beach. A planned family trip to Epstein’s private Caribbean island in 2014 was later cancelled.\n\nThere are also allegations that Jagland sought Epstein’s help in securing a bank loan, although it remains unclear whether this occurred. Police have not confirmed whether that claim forms part of the charge.\n\nBeing named in the US files does not in itself indicate wrongdoing.\n\nJagland served as Norway’s prime minister from 1996 to 1997 and later chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee. He was secretary general of the Council of Europe from 2009 to 2019.\n\nThe case comes amid wider scrutiny in Norway after US authorities released millions of emails, images and investigative records related to Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nSeveral other Norwegian public figures have faced investigation or review over alleged links to Epstein, including diplomats and senior officials. Some have denied wrongdoing, while others have apologised for past associations.\n\nThe investigation into Jagland is ongoing.",

    "title": "Bangladesh’s incoming govt takes office with economy at crossroads",
    "body": "As Bangladesh prepares for the formation of a new government following the 13th national election, expectations are running high among depositors, investors and job seekers seeking relief from prolonged financial strain.\n\nThe BNP-led alliance is set to assume office amid mounting economic pressures, with questions swirling over who will take charge of the finance ministry and what policy direction the new administration will adopt to tackle banking fragility, stubborn inflation and sluggish job creation.\n\nFor Abdul Hamid, a retired government employee, said the stakes are deeply personal.\n\nHe has been unable to recover Tk 24 lakh that he placed as a fixed deposit in a private bank.\n\n“I expected the new government that they will return my Tk 24 lakh, which was fixed and deposited in a private bank. But the bank fails to pay me the principal amount and benefits,” Hamid told UNB.\n\nHe said many depositors in several private sector banks face similar hardship, with institutions unable to repay funds, leaving families struggling due to a lack of liquidity.\n\nStock market investors are also looking for signs of a turnaround. Golam Azad, 45, invested around Tk 35 lakh in 2007 after being encouraged by a friend to seek higher returns.\n\nHe suffered losses during the stock market scams of 2010 and 2011 and has since waited for a sustained recovery.\n\nAzad said he hopes the incoming democratic government will take meaningful steps to support market stability and protect investors.\n\nYoung graduates represent another anxious constituency.\n\nWashim Habib, who completed his degree at a public university in 2021, has sat for the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) and other government recruitment examinations but remains unemployed.\n\nHabib said he is seeking employment in either the public or private sector, noting that his elderly parents can no longer continue to support his expenses.\n\nHe expressed hope that the new democratic government will create opportunities to help him secure suitable work.\n\nFinance Adviser Flags Structural Challenges\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Dr. Salehuddin Ahmed, Finance Adviser to the interim administration, has issued a pointed warning about the scale of the economic challenges awaiting the next leadership.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Bangladesh Secretariat, he said the primary mission of the incoming government must be revitalising trade and industry while strengthening financial institutions to ensure long-term stability.\n\nJob creation, he stressed, is central to restoring economic momentum.\n\n“If business does not expand, employment will not be generated. And without employment, the purchasing power of the people will remain weak. This is one of the biggest challenges,” he said.\n\nHe urged policymakers to foster a vibrant private sector, arguing that the country’s industrial base remains relatively small and overly dependent on exports.\n\nInflation and Banking Sector Strains\n\nInflation, he said, remains a “multidimensional problem” that cannot be resolved through monetary policy alone.\n\nWhile the interim administration has introduced several measures, broader and more comprehensive steps will be required to provide relief.\n\nOn banking sector reform, the adviser acknowledged that reorganisation efforts are under way but cautioned that “difficult decisions” lie ahead.\n\nHe praised recent initiatives by the central bank governor but noted that credit flow remains constrained and full public confidence in the banking system has yet to return, despite a recent uptick in deposits.\n\nCapital Market and Energy Reform\n\nTo reduce overreliance on banks, Dr Salehuddin called for deeper capital market development.\n\n“If we cannot develop the capital market, trade and commerce will not grow by relying solely on banks. Equity participation through the stock market and a strong bond market, especially for the private sector, are essential,” he said.\n\nHe said regulatory reform efforts are being slowed by legal complexities and ongoing court challenges.\n\nThe energy sector, he warned, poses a 'major long-term challenge'.\n\nHe called for intensified domestic exploration, including offshore drilling, and expressed disappointment at the slower-than-expected progress in solar energy development.\n\nThe insurance sector, he said, remains another 'sensitive area' where reform momentum has been limited despite various initiatives.\n\nAs the new administration prepares to take the oath of office, its first 100 days are likely to be defined by how effectively it can stabilise markets, restore investor confidence and translate high public expectations into tangible economic gains, economists said.",

    "title": "Reforming Bangladesh’s Cigarette Tax: A Path to Greater Revenue and Public Health",
    "body": "A recent simulation-based study conducted by Policy Exchange, offers valuable insight into the performance and future potential of Bangladesh’s cigarette taxation framework. The findings challenge a long-held assumption within fiscal policymaking: that simply raising taxes - without addressing the underlying structure - automatically leads to higher revenue and stronger public health outcomes.\n\nThe study compares three different tax models: the existing four tier ad valorem excise system, a fully specific excise model, and a mixed system. Through this comparison, it demonstrates that structural reform is not only beneficial but increasingly necessary for Bangladesh to achieve both revenue efficiency and public health goals.\n\nThe analysis finds that moving to a fully specific excise system - where a certain tax amount is applied per stick rather than as a percentage of price - would deliver significantly stronger results.\n\nAccording to the model, cumulative government revenue over the next ten years would increase by approximately BDT 22,000 crore compared to what the current system would generate. This dramatic improvement stems from the predictability, transparency, and reduced loopholes inherent in a specific excise structure.\n\nImportantly, the advantages are not limited to fiscal gains. The study also shows that cigarette consumption would decrease by an additional 8.6% under a fully specific excise system.\n\nThis reduction represents a meaningful step toward achieving national public health objectives. A system that is both more effective at curbing consumption and more efficient at raising revenue presents a rare winning scenario for policymakers - strengthening the state’s financial capacity while advancing long-term health outcomes.\n\nInternational experience supports this approach, said Hasnat Alam, economist and senior manager at Policy Exchange Bangladesh, noting that countries relying more on specific excise taxes secure more predictable revenue flows and stronger tobacco control outcomes.\n\nCiting the World Health Organization, Alam said the number of countries using pure specific tobacco tax increased to 70 in 2024 from 56 in 2008, while only 33 nations now follow pure ad valorem taxation, down from 56.\n\nPEB also urged the government to adopt a multi-year roadmap for tobacco tax reform, including tier simplification, inflation-indexed rate adjustments and enhanced monitoring capacity, to ensure a smooth transition and sustained fiscal and public health gains.\n\nThe research findings reinforce a clear conclusion: reforming the existing tax structure is not merely an option but a strategic necessity. A move toward a fully specific excise system promises stronger revenue performance, a more resilient tax architecture, and measurable improvements in public health - providing policymakers with compelling evidence to modernize the current framework.",

The NIS said her increasing public presence and involvement in state events indicate she is now in the stage of “successor designation.”\n\nLawmakers said Ju Ae has attended events like the founding anniversary of the Korean People’s Army and visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun.

    "body": "Al-Jazeera:: Pakistan’s Supreme Court has ordered an urgent medical review of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after a court-appointed lawyer reported that he has lost most of the vision in his right eye.\n\nBarrister Salman Safdar, appointed as amicus curiae (friend of the court), met Khan for about two hours on February 10 at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi and later submitted a seven-page report to the court on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the report, the 73-year-old former premier now has only 15 percent vision in his right eye after authorities allegedly failed to act on his complaints of blurred and hazy sight for nearly three months. Safdar wrote that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in that eye.\n\nA medical report dated February 6 diagnosed him with right central retinal vein occlusion, a condition caused by a blood clot that can seriously damage the retina. An eye specialist from a government hospital in Islamabad confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nSafdar noted that Khan appeared distressed during their meeting, with watery eyes throughout the conversation. The report warned that any further delay in treatment could pose serious risks and recommended an immediate independent examination by specialist ophthalmologists, including his personal doctors.\n\nFollowing the submission, the Supreme Court directed authorities to form a medical board to examine Khan and ordered that he be allowed to speak by phone with his sons, who live in the United Kingdom. The court asked that both steps be completed before February 16, with Chief Justice Yahya Afridi stressing that Khan’s health required urgent attention.\n\nKhan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), expressed deep concern over his deteriorating eyesight and criticised prison authorities. The party said it may pursue legal action against officials and demanded unrestricted access to his personal physicians, transfer to a reputable hospital for specialised treatment, and restoration of full family visitation rights.\n\nKhan, a former cricket captain who led Pakistan to a World Cup victory, served as prime minister from 2018 until he was removed in a no-confidence vote in 2022. He has been jailed since August 2023 on multiple charges, which his party describes as politically motivated.\n\nSafdar’s report also stated that Khan has been held in solitary confinement for about two years and four months and has had limited access to his legal team and family members. In June 2024, a United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said his detention lacked legal basis and appeared aimed at barring him from political office.\n\nThe case has further intensified political tensions in Pakistan, with analysts calling for transparency regarding the former prime minister’s health and prison conditions.",

Prior to last year’s conflict, Tehran had enriched uranium to 60% purity, a level close to weapons-grade material.\n\nTrump’s comments about potentially ending the rule of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei came weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned that political change in Iran would be far more complicated than efforts to unseat Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nRubio noted in a Senate hearing that Iran’s leadership has been entrenched for decades and would require careful consideration if change were pursued.\n\nTrump also announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, currently in the Caribbean, will head to the Middle East to join the USS Abraham Lincoln and other U.S. naval assets already in the region.\n\nHe said the additional carrier would be needed if diplomatic efforts fail, adding that it would depart soon.\n\nWhile Trump had indicated new talks with Iran might take place this week, negotiations did not occur. Iranian officials instead traveled to Oman and Qatar to exchange messages through intermediaries.\n\nGulf Arab states have warned that any military strike could trigger broader regional conflict, particularly as the Middle East remains tense following the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Inside Iran, authorities are facing renewed domestic pressure as citizens hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for those killed during recent nationwide protests.\n\nThe Ford strike group would add more than 5,000 personnel to U.S. forces in the Middle East, effectively doubling available aircraft and munitions. However, given its current location, it could take weeks before it reaches waters near Iran.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened military action if Iran does not agree to stricter limits on its nuclear activities. Indirect talks were held in Oman last week, and he warned that failing to reach a deal would have serious consequences.\n\nThe Ford was previously redeployed to the Caribbean as part of the U.S. military buildup ahead of last month’s operation that led to Maduro’s capture.\n\nExtending the carrier’s deployment could place strain on its crew. The ship has been at sea since June 2025, approaching eight months. Navy officials have previously said prolonged deployments disrupt service members’ personal lives and complicate maintenance schedules.\n\nAircraft carriers are typically deployed for six or seven months. Longer missions can increase wear on ships and delay scheduled repairs, as seen with the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which underwent a nine-month Middle East deployment in 2023–24 and remains in maintenance beyond its planned completion date.\n\nSenior Navy leaders have recently expressed a preference for deploying smaller, newer vessels where possible instead of relying heavily on large aircraft carriers.",

    "title": "Toy Fair Nuremberg Spielwarenmesse: 75 years in the global toy industry",
    "body": "By: Felix Ernesto ARIAS HÜCK\n\nThe 75th Nuremberg Spielwarenmesse took place from January 27th to 31st and will remain a milestone for the industry: The wintriest edition in years, filled with anniversary celebrations and a special atmosphere.\n\nFrom 27 to 31 January in Nuremberg, 2,313 exhibitors from 68 countries presented a vast array of products – including the growing “Kidults” segment. Around 58,900 trade visitors (+2.5%) from 121 nations explored new trends, fresh formats, and networking opportunities with enthusiasm.\n\nRight on Time\n\nDespite ongoing geopolitical challenges, the industry mood was upbeat. 93% of exhibitors – 3% more than last year – rated their participation as successful. Mattel hosted several global launches, while the Simba Dickie Group praised the high quality of trade visitors. “No other fair matches the international significance of Spielwarenmesse,” said Florian Sieber. Visitor numbers from the USA remained strong, with China and Hong Kong posting major gains thanks to a non-overlapping Chinese New Year. Growth was also recorded from Mexico, Turkey, the UK, and France, while Germany maintained its elevated level from last year. The event’s international spirit and festive mood were reflected in strong media coverage. “We were delighted by the tremendous media interest – lots of TV team, national press and content creators,” said Roger Kettler of Carrera Revell Europe.\n\nAI and Creative Mindfulness\n\nGroundbreaking impulses were provided by the two ToyTrends “AI Loves (to) Play” and “Creative Mindfulness”. Through numerous product examples, they were brought to life at the Spielwarenmesse just as vividly as “Toys for Kidults”. The hype surrounding adults who play has enabled iDventure to make its breakthrough – and to win one of the six coveted ToyAward prizes. “Winning has led to more positive stress for us and contributed to greater attention at our booth,” says Christoph Kossendey with delight. Leonard Mieg from Tipp-Kick, one of the 14 original exhibitors, reports a higher frequency of specialist retailers from the DACH region. “Spielwarenmesse is a must-see for anyone in the toy business — a high-energy event with a diverse product selection,” says Kathy Trivsonno from the US-American trade association Astra.\n\nLicensing Business\n\nThe Spielwarenmesse is also impressive proof of the success and relevance of the licensing business. “This is evident not only in the exhibition areas, but also in the License Lounge and our neighboring Licensing International booth, which have become the licensing industry's home base at the fair,” emphasizes Petra Strobl from Licensing International Germany. Valuable toy know-how was once again shared in the Toy Business Forum. The Value of Play Conference celebrated a successful premiere here. “The event offered high-quality, well-curated content, and the practical examples and concrete market figures significantly enriched my trade fair conversations,” says Polish publisher Dorota Mazurek. The Game Inventors Convention also met with great approval, with international games organizations represented for the first time. Mary Couzin from the Chicago Toy and Game Group was also present: “The atmosphere created a pull effect that benefited everyone – a great exchange for the game community.”\n\nThe ToyNight\n\nIn addition to content-driven impulses, the fair also set new standards in the increasing networking of participants. “Spielwarenmesse is the best networking opportunity for the entire toy industry,” says Lucca Liv from Unique Baby in Denmark. The exclusive ToyNight united all exhibitors under the motto “Welcome to the Future,” while the RedNight on Thursday created a lively atmosphere in the exhibition halls. René Bleckmann from Party Factory emphasizes: “The event is very, very important for us to get into conversation with customers and potential business partners and to celebrate with them.” The illuminations of Kaiserburg and Frauentorturm underlined the festive mood in ToyCity Nuremberg, where some trade fair participants experienced snow for the first time.\n\nThe high level of exhibitor satisfaction is also reflected in the figures: 90% of companies plan to exhibit again in Nuremberg from 2 to 6 February 2027. “With this, Spielwarenmesse has once again confirmed its global leading position and underlined its role as the central meeting point for trade, industry and media, where inspiration, innovation and networking come together at the highest level,” summarizes Christian Ulrich, Spokesperson of the Executive Board at Spielwarenmesse eG.\n\nProfile\n\nAmong the world's largest yearly toy fairs, the Spielwarenmesse Nuremberg (January 27-31, Germany) offers sensory experiences, imaginative development, exploration of technology and physics, opportunities to compete in various sports, celebrate favorite characters, enjoy family outings, and create comfortable environments, regardless of age.\n\nSpielwarenmesse Nuremberg, the B2B trade fair for games, party and celebration supplies, children’s furnitures, bicycles, indoor and outdoor toys —from licensing to plush toys— is exclusively for professionals: international wholesale buyers of finished products or licensed products for manufacturing toys featuring branded characters, or publishers entering the toy and game industry with characters and designs from children's books.\n\nTo facilitate both the creative and cross-media processes, Spielwarenmesse hosts international agencies, consultancies, and game developers for different segments and regions of the world, who present ideas and concepts for new games in closed sessions for investors and production companies.\n\nOn a fair ground of 175.000 m2 with 12 Halls with several floors and stages the largest international trade fair in the toy sector, Spielwarenmesse offers access to the best resources from each country.\n\nAlthough the nominees for the Toy Award suggest a clear desire towards becoming and returning to basic materials for a more sensory and sensitive play experience, manufactures and retailers continue to focus on increasingly sophisticated and captivating motorized plastic toys at a globally competitive price.\n\nSpielwarenmesse 2027 takes place the first week of February, from Tuesday 2nd to 6th.\n\nhttps://www.spielwarenmesse.de/en/",

    "title": "Deaths in Iran’s protests top 7,000, activists say amid rising tensions",
    "body": "Activists say the death toll from Iran’s nationwide crackdown on protests last month has reached at least 7,002, with many more feared dead.\n\nThe gradual increase in reported fatalities adds to mounting tensions inside Iran and abroad as the country engages in stalled negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program. A second round of talks remains uncertain, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly pressed U.S. President Donald Trump to take a harder line on Tehran.\n\n“There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated. If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference,” Trump wrote on his TruthSocial account. He added that previous attempts at deals had failed and hoped Iran would now act more reasonably.\n\nAt home, Iran continues to face public anger over its harsh suppression of dissent. This resentment may grow as families of the dead begin observing the traditional 40-day mourning period.\n\nActivist figures and verification\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which reported the latest figures, has a history of accurately tracking deaths in past unrest in Iran. The organization relies on a network of contacts within the country and has gradually verified fatalities amid difficult communications.\n\nIran’s government last reported a death toll of 3,117 on Jan. 21. Historically, Iranian authorities have undercounted or withheld fatality figures during unrest. The Associated Press has been unable to independently confirm the latest figures due to restricted internet and international communications in Iran.\n\nDiplomatic developments\n\nSenior Iranian security official Ali Larijani met in Qatar on Wednesday with Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. He also held meetings with Hamas representatives and, in Oman, with Houthi rebels backed by Tehran. Larijani told Al Jazeera there was no formal U.S. proposal but an “exchange of messages” took place.\n\nQatar, which shares a major offshore natural gas field with Iran, has often played a mediating role. Its state news agency reported that Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani discussed regional tensions and de-escalation efforts with President Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, additional ships, and warplanes to the Middle East to exert pressure on Iran and maintain strike capabilities if needed. U.S. forces have already shot down a drone near the carrier and intervened to assist a U.S.-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz. Trump told Axios that a second carrier may be sent to the region.\n\nNobel laureate Narges Mohammadi in danger\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed deep concern over reports that 2023 Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has been subjected to physical abuse, harsh interrogation, and life-threatening mistreatment in prison. The committee called for her immediate and unconditional release.\n\nMohammadi, 53, was sentenced to over seven more years in prison. She had been on furlough in December 2024 for medical reasons, but supporters had warned she faced re-arrest. The committee noted she has fainted multiple times, suffers from high blood pressure, and has been denied medical follow-up for suspected breast tumors.",

    "title": "Restore trust, enforce discipline at Sammilito Islami Bank",
    "body": "The launch of Sammilito Islami Bank marks a critical turning point for Bangladesh’s troubled banking sector. After months of frozen accounts, uncertainty and public anxiety, the resumption of normal banking operations under a single, consolidated Islamic bank has offered long-awaited relief to depositors. Early transaction data presented by Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H. Mansur—showing no excessive withdrawal pressure and even fresh deposits—suggests that public confidence, though still fragile, is gradually returning.\n\nThis confidence must now be protected through action, not assurances. The merger of five distressed Islamic banks—EXIM Bank, Social Islami Bank, First Security Islami Bank, Global Islami Bank and Union Bank—was completed with unprecedented speed. While the central bank deserves credit for steering this complex process, the real challenge begins now: ensuring that Sammilito Islami Bank does not repeat the failures that crippled its predecessors.\n\nAt the heart of this challenge lies professionalism. The new bank’s directors and staff must demonstrate a level of efficiency, integrity and discipline that clearly sets them apart from the past. Banking decisions—particularly loan approvals—must be guided strictly by merit, risk assessment and commercial viability. Political identity, family connections or informal influence cannot be allowed to shape outcomes. The banking sector was badly damaged when loans were granted on the basis of power and proximity rather than sound business judgment.\n\nThe central bank’s commitment to forensic audits of the five merged banks is therefore a crucial step. Such scrutiny is not about revenge; it is about restoring institutional credibility. Corruption in banking rarely occurs without internal compromise. When staff adhere strictly to rules and regulations, large-scale loan irregularities become nearly impossible. Identifying those who violated procedures, ignored red flags or facilitated abuse is essential to ensure that accountability is real, not symbolic.\n\nAt the same time, accountability must be fair and targeted. The Governor’s assurance that employees will not be dismissed indiscriminately is sensible. Many staff members may have worked under political pressure or flawed leadership. However, those proven to be involved in financial misconduct must face consequences without exception. Selective justice would only deepen public distrust and weaken the reform effort.\n\nSystem integration presents another major test. Unifying the technological platforms, internal controls and risk management systems of five separate banks is a demanding task. Any disruption or mismanagement during this phase could quickly undermine depositor confidence. While Bangladesh Bank’s technical support is vital, Sammilito Islami Bank must ultimately build a strong, modern institutional framework capable of operating independently and responsibly.\n\nBeyond its immediate operations, Sammilito Islami Bank carries broader significance. Its success—or failure—will shape public perception of whether meaningful reform is possible in a banking sector damaged by years of misgovernance and political interference. A well-run Sammilito Islami Bank could become a model for restoring discipline and trust. A poorly governed one would reinforce fears that structural problems remain unresolved.\n\nThe path forward is clear. To justify public confidence, Sammilito Islami Bank must enforce discipline, uphold transparency and apply rules without fear or favour. Only by doing so can it help rebuild a banking system that serves the economy and depositors—rather than vested interests—and mark a genuine break from the failures of the past.",

    "title": "Tarique Rahman Takes the helm at a defining moment for BNP",
    "body": "Tarique Rahman’s formal assumption of the chairmanship of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) marks a long-anticipated and constitutionally grounded transition in the party’s leadership. After serving nearly seven years as Acting Chairman, his elevation is neither abrupt nor controversial; rather, it reflects continuity within the party structure following the death of former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia.\n\nBNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir’s announcement after an emergency meeting of the National Standing Committee has put to rest any ambiguity regarding leadership. As per the BNP constitution, once the post of Chairman falls vacant, the Senior Vice Chairman assumes the role for the remainder of the term. Tarique Rahman had long fulfilled this responsibility in practice, steering the party from exile during a difficult period marked by repression, organisational strain and political uncertainty. The formalisation of his role therefore aligns with both the letter and spirit of the party’s charter.\n\nYet while the transition was expected, its timing is politically momentous. Tarique Rahman takes charge at a juncture when Bangladesh is preparing for a crucial national election and the BNP stands as a leading contender for state power. Various political assessments and surveys suggest that the party enjoys a strong electoral position across the 300 parliamentary constituencies. With that prospect comes not only opportunity, but also an immense burden of responsibility.\n\nBangladesh today faces deep structural challenges. Years of authoritarian governance under Sheikh Hasina have left scars across institutions, the economy and social cohesion. Democratic norms were weakened, public trust eroded, and key state institutions politicised. Whoever forms the next government will inherit the task of rebuilding a fractured polity while navigating economic stress, global uncertainty and rising public expectations.\n\nFor the BNP, this means that electoral victory alone will not suffice. The party must demonstrate readiness to govern in a vastly more complex environment than before. Policy clarity, institutional reform, economic recovery and restoration of democratic accountability will be central tests. How the BNP conducts itself before the election—through candidate selection, alliances, messaging and commitment to peaceful democratic processes—will be as important as its conduct after the polls.\n\nTarique Rahman’s leadership will therefore be scrutinised closely. His political career has evolved over decades, from grassroots organising to strategic planning at the national level. He has overseen the party during one of its most challenging phases, keeping it intact despite sustained pressure. That experience may serve him well now. At the same time, the demands of the coming period require not only experience, but also wisdom, inclusiveness, integrity and a clear vision for a modern, democratic Bangladesh.\n\nThe BNP is not short of seasoned leaders or capable professionals. Harnessing that collective strength, encouraging internal democracy and engaging constructively with civil society will be critical. In an interconnected global landscape, governance challenges transcend borders; economic resilience, diplomatic balance and social harmony demand skillful, forward-looking leadership.\n\nAs Tarique Rahman begins his tenure as BNP Chairman, he inherits both a legacy and a mandate. The road ahead is fraught with challenges, but also rich with possibility. We welcome his new journey and hope that under his leadership, the BNP rises to the occasion—serving not just partisan interests, but the broader aspirations of the Bangladeshi people for democracy, stability and renewal.",

    "title": "Australia–Bangladesh Trade Booms: From Early Diplomatic Ties to Multi-Billion Dollar Partnership",
    "body": "By: Maqsood Al-Kabir\n\nAustralia and Bangladesh have developed one of the fastest-growing trade relationships in the South Asia–Pacific corridor, with bilateral trade exceeding A$5 billion in 2024.\n\nThe partnership, grounded in historical ties dating back to Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, is now expanding beyond traditional goods into education, services, energy, and infrastructure.\n\nAustralia was among the first developed nations to recognise Bangladesh after its nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan. The Australian Cabinet formally acknowledged Bangladesh on 25 January 1972, and a resident diplomatic mission was established in Dhaka on 31 January 1972.\n\nThis early recognition helped Bangladesh gain international legitimacy and paved the way for its entry into the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nAustralian diplomats were active behind the scenes, advocating for recognition at international forums, demonstrating Canberra’s proactive foreign policy approach at a critical juncture in South Asian geopolitics.\n\nDuring the 1971 conflict, Australian civil society mobilised to support the Bangladeshi population. Expatriates, students, journalists, and community groups organised fundraising, awareness campaigns, and lobbying efforts to press for increased government aid. Millions of refugees and displaced persons benefited from these initiatives, establishing enduring people-to-people ties between the two countries. Individual Australians also contributed directly. William A. S. Ouderland, a Dutch-Australian, trained Mukti Bahini guerrillas and provided logistical and medical support during the war, earning Bangladesh’s Bir Protik award. Australian physician Dr. Geoffrey Davis assisted survivors in 1972, particularly women affected by wartime atrocities, under the auspices of international organisations including WHO. Political leaders such as Gough Whitlam, then Opposition Leader and later Prime Minister, were instrumental in advocating recognition, reinforcing Australia’s principled stance and laying the foundation for lasting diplomatic and economic engagement.\n\nBilateral trade remained modest through the late 20th century. A turning point came in 2003, when Australia extended Duty-Free Quota-Free (DFQF) market access to Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Bangladesh, an LDC at the time, gained near-unrestricted access for its ready-made garments (RMG) and other products.\n\nBy the late 2010s, bilateral goods trade surpassed A$2.6 billion, with Bangladesh exporting mainly RMG and Australia supplying cotton, wheat, lentils, dairy components, and industrial materials—critical inputs for Bangladesh’s manufacturing and textile industries.\n\nThe Australia–Bangladesh Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement (TIFA), signed in 2021, established a formal platform for trade facilitation, market access discussions, and investment promotion. Complementing this, the Australia–Bangladesh Business Exchange (ABBX) supports Australian firms exploring opportunities in agribusiness, education, energy, and technology sectors.\n\nTwo-way trade has expanded at an average annual growth rate of over 16%, reaching approximately A$5 billion in 2024. Bangladesh is now Australia’s 22nd largest export destination. Over 90% of exports from Bangladesh to Australia are RMG, with minor contributions from leather goods, processed foods, fish, and jute products.\n\nAustralia’s exports to Bangladesh are dominated by agricultural and industrial inputs, including cotton, natural fibres, wheat, lentils, vegetables, oilseeds, minerals, metals, and dairy components. Education has become a major sector, with Bangladeshi students contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to the Australian economy annually.\n\nPeople-to-people links are further strengthened by over 73,000 Bangladesh-born residents in Australia. Bangladesh retains DFQF privileges under TIFA, ensuring continued preferential access to the Australian market, even after its expected graduation from LDC status in 2026.\n\nDespite the strong growth trajectory, the trade relationship faces several challenges. Bangladesh faces political tensions, social unrest, and external trade pressures that could affect investor confidence and export flows to Australia. Heavy reliance on RMG exposes Bangladesh to demand fluctuations and potential tariff changes post-LDC graduation, highlighting the need for diversification into higher-value products and services.\n\nAustralian foreign direct investment in Bangladesh remains limited, indicating potential for expansion in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and digital technologies.\n\nLooking ahead, both governments are exploring ways to broaden trade. Education, healthcare, digital technologies, and agribusiness are emerging opportunities, with Australian institutions well positioned to provide training and capacity building in line with Bangladesh’s growth ambitions.\n\nBangladesh’s infrastructure expansion and renewable energy targets—including 40% of energy from renewable sources by 2041—create avenues for Australian participation in energy transition projects, technology transfer, and infrastructure development. Strategically, both countries share interests in a rules-based Indo-Pacific, leveraging trade cooperation to strengthen regional security and multilateral engagement.\n\nBangladesh’s 2026 graduation from LDC status could shift some trade dynamics, but Australia has pledged continued DFQF access, providing certainty for exporters and encouraging policy reforms that support integration into global value chains.\n\nFrom early recognition and humanitarian support during the 1971 Liberation War to today’s multi-billion-dollar trading partnership, Australia and Bangladesh have built a resilient and diversified economic relationship.\n\nComplementary sectors—Australia’s agricultural and industrial inputs and Bangladesh’s textile and services industries—have formed a robust bilateral corridor. With institutional frameworks like TIFA, expanding services trade, and shared strategic interests, the trajectory of engagement is promising.\n\nAddressing structural risks, fostering investment, and diversifying trade will be key to sustaining growth. The Australia–Bangladesh trading exchange stands as a model of practical diplomacy and mutually beneficial economic cooperation in the 21st century.\n\nThe Author:\n\nMaqsood Al-Kabir, an Australian of Bangladeshi heritage, is a human rights consultant with a focus on business advisory, communications, and public affairs.

    "body": "Stating that justice will be the guiding principle of his future government in ensuring the rule of law, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman on Saturday sought cooperation from all political parties and forces in building a ‘safe and humane Bangladesh’.\n\nAddressing a post-election press conference at a city hotel, the BNP chairman also placed the highest importance on maintaining peace and order in the country, saying law and order must be kept normal at any cost and that no form of violence, retaliation, provocative activities, or wrongdoing will be tolerated.\n\n“On the journey toward building a safe, humane and democratic Bangladesh, I seek the cooperation of all, regardless of party or opinion,” he said at his first press conference after his party secured a massive election victory.\n\nTarique said while competing against one another, misunderstandings or discord may have arisen in some places during the election. “I urge everyone to ensure that such disputes do not turn into revenge or retaliation.”\n\nHe called upon all democracy-loving people of the country to contribute to combating corruption, maintaining law and order, and ensuring accountability to the people from their respective positions so that Bangladesh may be established as a safe and humane nation.\n\nMentioning that the country have once again given the mandate to BNP, Tarique said the trust and love that the people have shown toward BNP must now be repaid through tireless and united efforts to improve the quality of life of the country’s citizens.\n\n“I thank the BNP leaders, activists, and supporters across the country. Despite severe oppression and persecution, you did not leave the streets. You remained steadfast in the struggle to establish democracy. Now it is time to build the nation,” he said.\n\nIn this journey of rebuilding the country, the BNP chief said each and every one of us must play a responsible role. “We have celebrated this victory of democracy and human rights peacefully and with dignity.”\n\nHe called upon all BNP leaders and activists across the country to remain calm and vigilant to ensure that no unpleasant incidents occur anywhere in post-election Bangladesh despite numerous provocations, so that no malicious force can exploit the situation to create unrest.\n\nHe also said even after achieving a landslide victory, Tarique said he instructed BNP and allied party leaders and activists not to hold victory processions, adding that the victory was instead celebrated by offering thanks to Almighty Allah.\n\n“Our position is clear. Peace and order must be maintained at any cost. No wrongdoing or unlawful activity will be tolerated. Regardless of party, religion, race, or differing opinions, under no circumstances will attacks by the strong against the weak be accepted. Justice will be our guiding principle,” the BNP Chairman said.\n\nHe said if the rule of law is not established, all efforts would be in vain and stressed that in upholding the rule of law—whether in government or in opposition and regardless of differing views—the law must be equal for every citizen of Bangladesh, and it would be enforced in accordance with statutory provisions.\n\nTarique congratulated the people of Bangladesh after his party’s landslide victory in the 13th national election. “I congratulate the people of Bangladesh. By overcoming all obstacles, you have paved the way for the establishment of democracy in the country.”\n\n“This victory belongs to Bangladesh. This victory belongs to democracy. This victory belongs to the people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy. From today, we are all free, with the true essence of freedom and rights restored,” he added.\n\nTarique said they are about to begin their journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions and a deteriorating law and order situation.\n\nWith people’s spontaneous participation, he said, a parliament and government accountable to the public through direct voting are being re-established in the country after more than one and a half decades.\n\n“To ensure that no evil force can re-establish autocracy in the country, and to ensure that the nation is not turned into a subservient state, we must remain united and uphold the will of the people,” the BNP Chairman said.\n\nTarique thanked the 51 political parties that took part in the election, saying political parties are the “beacons of democracy” in a democratic state. “If both the government and the opposition play responsible roles from their respective positions, democracy will surely take institutional form in the country.”\n\nHe called upon all democratic political parties that participated in the election, saying that their ideas and perspectives are important in the nation-building process.\n\n“Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country we are one. National unity is our strength; division is our weakness,” Tarique said, adding that constructive and democratic opinions from all parties would be important in state governance.\n\nHe said a free, fair, and credible election was finally held peacefully in the country, meeting the expectations of the people.\n\nThe BNP chief extended special thanks to the interim government and the Election Commission, noting that their contribution to holding the long-awaited election will be remembered in the history of democracy.\n\nHe said BNP presented a framework for repairing the state through discussions with other democratic parties and people across the country, known as the 31-point agenda.\n\n“Our election manifesto was formulated based on these 31 points. At the same time, BNP signed the July Charter with a note of dissent on certain issues. We are committed to the people and, Insha’Allah, will gradually implement every promise we have made,” Tarique said.\n\nHe said the victory of the party is a moment of great joy for BNP leaders, activists, and supporters across the country, as well as for all democracy-loving citizens.\n\nAccording to unofficial results, the BNP secured 209 seats in the parliamentary polls. Tarique Rahman was elected from both Dhaka-17 and Bogura-6 constituencies.\n\nMembers of the BNP Standing Committee were also present at the press conference.",

    "title": "Bangladesh poultry industry fears market concentration as govt moves to restrict parent stock imports",
    "body": "The country’s poultry industry has expressed concern over a proposed policy that would impose conditions on the import of parent stock, warning it could gradually concentrate control of the Tk 50,000 crore ($4.5 billion approx.) sector in the hands of a few large corporate groups.\n\nThe government recently approved a draft of the National Poultry Development Policy 2026, which includes restrictions on the import of parent stock chicks. Industry stakeholders say that unless the policy is revised to reflect ground realities, it may disrupt production, reduce competition and ultimately cause price volatility for eggs and chicken meat at the consumer level.\n\nUnder Clause 5.8.1.2 of the draft policy, approved at an advisory council meeting on Jan. 22, only day-old grandparent (GP) stock may be imported as a rule. Import of parent stock chicks would be permitted only “in special circumstances” in the event of a shortage of day-old grandparent stock or chicks.\n\nIndustry representatives say the policy does not clearly define what constitutes “special circumstances,” how a shortage would be determined, or whether the provision applies equally to broiler, layer and coloured birds. The lack of clarity, they argue, is a major source of concern.\n\nAccording to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), commercial poultry production in Bangladesh includes broilers, layers and coloured birds. While layer and coloured bird parent stock remain largely import-dependent, 19 companies are registered to produce broiler parent stock domestically.\n\nHowever, industry insiders say several of these registered entities belong to the same corporate groups, and many GP farms are leased to larger firms. As a result, effective control of parent stock production is concentrated among five to six major corporate groups.\n\nMore than 300 breeder farms across the country rely on these firms for parent stock chicks to produce day-old commercial chicks. Stakeholders warn that any disease outbreak, production disruption or management failure at one of these companies could trigger a nationwide supply crisis.\n\nThey also fear that reduced import flexibility could strengthen the bargaining power of a few dominant players, leaving hatcheries with little choice but to buy at prices set by large companies or halt production.\n\n“If import channels are narrowed, managing supply shocks will be nearly impossible,” said several farm operators, noting that importing parent stock is a lengthy process that typically takes five to six months. After arrival, rearing the birds, producing hatching eggs and bringing day-old chicks to market can take an additional seven to eight months. Resolving a major supply disruption could therefore take up to two years.\n\nFarmers question official claims of surplus production, pointing to periodic spikes in day-old chick prices. Broiler chicks have at times sold for Tk 60–70 each, while layer chicks have reached Tk 100.\n\nThey argue that there is no mandatory, transparent reporting system detailing how much parent stock each company produces, making it risky to base policy decisions solely on GP import data.\n\nRecent data show broiler parent stock imports have declined from 2.4 million in fiscal year 2019–20 to 1.1 million in 2023–24.\n\nAccording to DLS sources, Bangladesh imported 2.152 million parent stock birds in 2025, including 1.1 million broiler parent stock. Total parent stock production stood at 8.2 million against a capacity of about 8.7 million, while overall demand is estimated at around 10.4 million. This leaves an annual gap of roughly 1.6 million birds that must be met through imports. Officials say Bangladesh has already achieved self-sufficiency in broiler parent stock production.\n\nIndustry leaders say Bangladesh has yet to achieve full self-sufficiency in overall parent stock production and that restricting imports at this stage could jeopardize food security and the livelihoods of thousands of small-scale farmers.\n\nMosharraf Hossain Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association, said policy decisions must prioritize farmers’ interests.\n\n“The poultry industry is not just a business; it is closely linked to food security. Farmers must be able to purchase chicks on time and at fair prices,” he said.\n\nMd. Imran Hossain, managing director of Oyster Poultry and Fisheries Ltd in Sylhet, said keeping import options open is critical for price stability and disease risk management.\n\n“If there is a sudden bird flu outbreak or large-scale chick mortality, emergency imports will not be feasible overnight,” he said.\n\n“Import provisions should remain open in a balanced way, without undermining domestic industry.”\n\nDr. Jahangir Alam, a former director general of the Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute and an agricultural economist, said some restrictions on chick imports may be justified but a limited import window should remain for producers and marketers to address shortfalls and encourage new hatcheries.\n\nDLS Director (Production) A.B.M. Khaleduzzaman said the draft policy was formulated with the overall development of the poultry sector in mind.\n\n“We believe that once implemented, the policy will further strengthen the country’s poultry industry,” he said.\n\nIndustry stakeholders, however, caution that unless the policy ensures transparency, competition and flexibility in imports, it risks creating new vulnerabilities in a sector critical to Bangladesh’s animal protein supply and rural employment.",

    "body": "As Bangladesh prepares for the formation of a new government following the 13th national election, expectations are running high among depositors, investors and job seekers seeking relief from prolonged financial strain.\n\nThe BNP-led alliance is set to assume office amid mounting economic pressures, with questions swirling over who will take charge of the finance ministry and what policy direction the new administration will adopt to tackle banking fragility, stubborn inflation and sluggish job creation.\n\nFor Abdul Hamid, a retired government employee, said the stakes are deeply personal.\n\nHe has been unable to recover Tk 24 lakh that he placed as a fixed deposit in a private bank.\n\n“I expected the new government that they will return my Tk 24 lakh, which was fixed and deposited in a private bank. But the bank fails to pay me the principal amount and benefits,” Hamid told UNB.\n\nHe said many depositors in several private sector banks face similar hardship, with institutions unable to repay funds, leaving families struggling due to a lack of liquidity.\n\nStock market investors are also looking for signs of a turnaround. Golam Azad, 45, invested around Tk 35 lakh in 2007 after being encouraged by a friend to seek higher returns.\n\nHe suffered losses during the stock market scams of 2010 and 2011 and has since waited for a sustained recovery.\n\nAzad said he hopes the incoming democratic government will take meaningful steps to support market stability and protect investors.\n\nYoung graduates represent another anxious constituency.\n\nWashim Habib, who completed his degree at a public university in 2021, has sat for the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) and other government recruitment examinations but remains unemployed.\n\nHabib said he is seeking employment in either the public or private sector, noting that his elderly parents can no longer continue to support his expenses.\n\nHe expressed hope that the new democratic government will create opportunities to help him secure suitable work.\n\nFinance Adviser Flags Structural Challenges\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Dr. Salehuddin Ahmed, Finance Adviser to the interim administration, has issued a pointed warning about the scale of the economic challenges awaiting the next leadership.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Bangladesh Secretariat, he said the primary mission of the incoming government must be revitalising trade and industry while strengthening financial institutions to ensure long-term stability.\n\nJob creation, he stressed, is central to restoring economic momentum.\n\n“If business does not expand, employment will not be generated. And without employment, the purchasing power of the people will remain weak. This is one of the biggest challenges,” he said.\n\nHe urged policymakers to foster a vibrant private sector, arguing that the country’s industrial base remains relatively small and overly dependent on exports.\n\nInflation and Banking Sector Strains\n\nInflation, he said, remains a “multidimensional problem” that cannot be resolved through monetary policy alone.\n\nWhile the interim administration has introduced several measures, broader and more comprehensive steps will be required to provide relief.\n\nOn banking sector reform, the adviser acknowledged that reorganisation efforts are under way but cautioned that “difficult decisions” lie ahead.\n\nHe praised recent initiatives by the central bank governor but noted that credit flow remains constrained and full public confidence in the banking system has yet to return, despite a recent uptick in deposits.\n\nCapital Market and Energy Reform\n\nTo reduce overreliance on banks, Dr Salehuddin called for deeper capital market development.\n\n“If we cannot develop the capital market, trade and commerce will not grow by relying solely on banks. Equity participation through the stock market and a strong bond market, especially for the private sector, are essential,” he said.\n\nHe said regulatory reform efforts are being slowed by legal complexities and ongoing court challenges.\n\nThe energy sector, he warned, poses a 'major long-term challenge'.\n\nHe called for intensified domestic exploration, including offshore drilling, and expressed disappointment at the slower-than-expected progress in solar energy development.\n\nThe insurance sector, he said, remains another 'sensitive area' where reform momentum has been limited despite various initiatives.\n\nAs the new administration prepares to take the oath of office, its first 100 days are likely to be defined by how effectively it can stabilise markets, restore investor confidence and translate high public expectations into tangible economic gains, economists said.",

    "title": "An overview of Ramadan and how Muslims observe the sacred month",
    "body": "Muslims around the world are preparing to observe Ramadan, the Islamic holy month marked by daily fasting from dawn until sunset. For the faithful, it is a period of intensified worship, spiritual reflection and charitable giving. It is also a socially significant time, as families and friends gather in the evenings to share meals that break the fast.\n\nRamadan concludes with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, one of Islam’s major holidays.\n\nRamadan likely to begin around Feb. 18-19\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, which rotates through the seasons. Its beginning is traditionally determined by the sighting of the crescent moon.\n\nThis year, Ramadan is expected to start on or about Feb. 18 or 19, although the exact date may vary from country to country. Differences arise because Islamic authorities worldwide may rely on moon sightings or distinct calculation methods to announce the start of the month.\n\nNotably, Ramadan this year is expected to commence around the same time as Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent, a solemn season of fasting and repentance for Catholics and many other Christians.\n\nFasting as a core pillar of Islam\n\nFasting during Ramadan is one of Islam’s Five Pillars, alongside the declaration of faith, daily prayers, almsgiving and pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nMuslims view fasting as both an act of devotion and a means of developing greater piety and self-discipline. Observers say it teaches patience, fosters gratitude and deepens empathy for those facing poverty and hunger.\n\nThroughout Ramadan, Muslims abstain from all food and drink — including water — between dawn and sunset. The fast is broken at sunset with a meal known as iftar. Before dawn, many eat a pre-fast meal called suhoor to prepare for the day ahead.\n\nMosques typically see increased attendance, with worshippers engaging in congregational prayers, recitation of the Quran and extended periods of contemplation.\n\nCharitable acts are especially emphasized. Many people distribute food packages, sponsor iftar meals for those in need or take part in community dinners that offer free meals.\n\nWho is exempt from fasting\n\nIslam provides exemptions for individuals who are unable to fast due to valid reasons such as illness or travel. Those who miss fasts for temporary reasons are generally required to make up the missed days later.\n\nCultural expressions and social traditions\n\nWhile fasting is a religious obligation, many customs associated with Ramadan are shaped by local culture. Traditions differ across regions, though communal gatherings after sunset are a common feature.\n\nSome families decorate their homes with Ramadan-themed ornaments and table settings, and markets and special bazaars often see increased activity.\n\nIn Egypt, the month takes on a festive atmosphere. Colorful lanterns adorn homes and streets, and traditional songs welcome the arrival of Ramadan. A long-standing custom involves a “mesaharati” walking through neighborhoods before dawn, beating a drum and calling out to residents to wake them for suhoor.\n\nTelevision programming also plays a prominent role in some countries, with new drama series released during the month and advertisers competing for audiences. While some Muslims express concern that commercial activities and lavish iftar gatherings may overshadow the spiritual focus of Ramadan, others believe a balance can be maintained.\n\nIn Indonesia, Ramadan practices reflect regional diversity. In Aceh province, for example, families observe Meugang by slaughtering livestock and sharing meat with relatives and the needy. In Tangerang, near Jakarta, residents gather at the Cisadane River for a symbolic cleansing ritual before the month begins. In parts of Sumatra, children and teenagers parade through the streets after evening prayers, carrying torches and singing Islamic songs.\n\nIn the United States, where Muslims represent a diverse minority, many families attend iftar meals and prayers at mosques and Islamic centers to strengthen communal bonds. Interfaith iftar gatherings are also organized in some communities to promote understanding and solidarity.\n\nAcross cultures and continents, Ramadan remains a time of devotion, generosity and shared experience for Muslims worldwide.",

A market leader in the segment.\n\nIn 2017 Brand Finance valued HAVAL as the “world’s most powerful SUV brand” ahead of jeep and Land Rover. With over 3 million customers.

    "body": "The 7 March Speech of Bangabandhu was a speech given by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh on 7 March 1971 to a gathering of over two million people. It was delivered during a period of escalating tensions between East Pakistan and the powerful political and military establishment of West Pakistan.\n\nHe announced a civil disobedience movement in the province, calling for \"every house to turn into a fortress\". The speech inspired the Bengali people to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilization by West Pakistan. The Bangladesh Liberation War began 18 days later when the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, intelligentsia, students, politicians, and armed personnel.\n\nIn his historic address, Sheikh Mujib declared, ‘Ebarer Sangram Amader Muktir Sangram, Ebarer Sangram Swadhinatar Sangram’ (The struggle this time is for our emancipation, the struggle this time is for the independence). He made the clarion call to turn every home into a fortress of resistance against the Pakistani army.\n\nBengalis reacted with unprecedented rage after the then Pakistani military ruler Yahya Khan postponed the National Assembly session scheduled for March 1, 1971. Stunned by the treachery, Sheikh Mujib immediately launched an unprecedented non-cooperation movement dealing a crippling blow to the military rulers.\n\nRead More: PM pays homage to Bangabandhu on historic 7th March\n\nAnd on March 7, 1971, he gave the historic address at Suhrawardy Udyan, the then Race Course, which inspired the nation to fight for independence. The address reduced the governmental authorities in then East Pakistan to useless showpieces as everything ran according to Mujib’s day-to-day edicts.\n\nThis continued until the military junta retaliated with the crackdown and the accompanying brutalities against the unarmed Bengalis on the fateful midnight of March 25, 1971, and the rest is history.\n\nThe historic March 7 speech of Mujib has been included in the memory of the World International Register, a list of the world’s important documentary heritage maintained by UNESCO.\n\n7th March Speech Paragraph\n\nDo you want to know about the 7th march speech paragraph?\n\nIn Bangladesh, the school and colleges arrange a competition for the 7th march speech. The students of schools and colleges participate in this competition. It is a very good opportunity for them to show their talent. They can learn many things from this competition. This is also an opportunity for them to get extra marks in exams as well as they can make their teachers happy by participating in this competition.\n\n7th march 1971, The crowd of people that gathered at the Suhrawardy Udyan Park was huge and seemed to be growing by the minute as more buses continued to arrive with their passengers from all corners of Bangladesh. Once everyone had gathered on the lawns in front of a makeshift stage built for this purpose, they settled down eagerly awaiting for their leader Sheikh Mujibor Rahman to deliver his speech.\n\nThis is a great day in Bangladesh. On this day in 1971, the great leader Mr. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gave an intelligent speech to over two million people. This speech inspired the Bengali people to prepare for war of independence. In 1970, the Awami League won victory in national elections winning 167 of the 169 seats and a majority in the National Assembly. The victory gave them constitutional rights to form a government.\n\nBut Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, was not happy that a Bengali person was going to become prime minister. They started their conspiracy and tried to resist the Awami Muslim League Party from gaining governing power. The situation got worse on March 7th when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made his speech at Dhaka's Ramna Race Course.\n\nFor joining the National Assembly on 25 March, he gave four conditions. He also gave some directives for a civil movement and told his countrymen what to do. His speech concluded with \"Joy Bangla!\" UNESCO put this speech in the Memory of the World Register as part of the world's documentary heritage on 30 October 2017. The speech on 7th March 1971 was important because it helped Bengalis know their goal of independence.",

    "body": "From comedy specials to scripted television, Muslim American creator Mo Amer draws heavily from his own life when telling stories, a choice that has resonated strongly with audiences and critics alike.\n\nAmer, a Palestinian American comedian, writer and actor, has earned widespread praise for his Netflix series “Mo.” Its second season follows the fictional Mo Najjar and his family as they navigate the challenges of seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing as Palestinian refugees. The show is part of a broader movement of television created by Arab American and Muslim American voices that explores identity with depth and realism, moving beyond long-standing stereotypes.\n\nAmer said grounding stories in real cultural experiences allows audiences of all backgrounds to connect. In the new season, Najjar is shown operating a falafel taco stand in Mexico after being caught in a failed attempt to recover stolen olive trees tied to his family’s hopes of starting an olive oil business.\n\nBoth seasons of “Mo” were major successes on Netflix, with the first earning a Peabody Award. Amer’s third Netflix stand-up special, “Mo Amer: Wild World,” debuted in October. While the series timeline ends before the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack in Israel, it addresses Israeli-Palestinian relations, the war in Gaza and the realities faced by asylum seekers in U.S. detention centers.\n\nOther programs also reflect this growing representation. “Muslim Matchmaker” features matchmakers helping Muslim Americans find spouses, while the animated series “#1 Happy Family USA,” created by Ramy Youssef and Pam Brady, centers on an Egyptian American Muslim family living in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nScholars note that portrayals of Arabs and Muslims have long been shaped by political and historical contexts. After 9/11, many U.S. shows depicted Muslims as villains, often conflating Arab identity with Islam. Earlier portrayals leaned on “orientalist” imagery, presenting Middle Eastern people through a colonial lens.\n\nExperts and industry figures say recent shows mark progress, but argue more diverse stories and decision-makers are still needed. Research also suggests positive representation can reduce public support for anti-Muslim policies.\n\nAmer said the main barriers remain with those who approve projects, not creators themselves. While recent successes are encouraging, he views them as only a beginning.",

But when they cannot stop at a certain point and keeps amassing wealth much beyond their ability to spend on a good cause, it is considered a mental aberration. Unlimited wealth gives unlimited power and that is when most of them turn to criminality to enjoy their acquired power.\n\nSheikh Hasina has surely seen many such people in her long political career since the time of her father. She has seen people who remain preoccupied with the goal of earning more money then what they needed in life and she must have been convinced about the poor intellectual state of such persons.\n\nAt the same time she must have seen a different genre of people to whom money was the secondary need while intellectual pursuit came first. She does not have to go far to find the best examples of such persons. Her own father, the father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was a man who had no unnatural desire to earn millions using his political clout. He definitely had the need for money but that was limited to the amount required to meet his daily expenses. But he had the scope to earn more money than what he needed to run his family. There are reasons to believe that the Adamjees, the Bawanees and the military governments of the time had offered him large sums to leave politics. They would have made him the richest Bangalee in this part of the world only if he would stop making their life miserable. But Bangabandhu was not someone who could be bought with money.\n\nIn the real world as well as in the world of literature there are dozens of stories on how greed for wealth brought about the downfall of many rich and powerful persons. At the same time there are examples of rich men giving away most of their money to charitable organisations opting to lead a simple life. Money did not bring the inner peace they have been seeking all along. At one point in life these people could perhaps comprehend that there was more satisfaction in giving than taking. Today’s richest man Bill Gates has decided to donate his wealth to charity. But our millionaires who earned 500 crore from illegal casino business and extortion, prefer to keep their money in foreign banks. If not stopped they would have earned 500 crore more by now. What is the value of their money?\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina is one head of\n\ngovernment in the world who has a clean slate\n\nas far as her personal moral standing and integrity\n\nare concerned. So, she does not only\n\npreach morality, she practices it too\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, with her maturity in politics and family life, can now read human mind with a greater degree of accuracy. She understands who around her are real friends, and who are only fair weather birds. She could identify people in her party, and even in her extended family, who are known for their uncontrollable greed for money. And she has taken action against some of them.\n\nShe also said very recently that it is better to eat rice with salt with your honestly earned income than to eat rich food with illegally earned money. Can we hope that people who are still busy amassing wealth through grabbing private and public land, collecting extortion money from trucks and buses, collecting tolls from markets and shops and factories, and squeezing money from poor job-seekers in the name of giving them jobs are listening to her good words.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina is one head of government in the world who has a clean slate as far as her personal moral standing and integrity are concerned. So, she does not only preach morality, she practices it too.\n\nShahnoor Wahid is Advisory Editor of Bangladesh Post",

    "body": "Staff Correspondent\n\nMentioning that the Election Day was peaceful and orderly, AFED, Alliance for Fair Election and Democracy, noted that the day had been peaceful and orderly and called for patience among parties, candidates and their supporters to ensure a smooth conclusion of the process.\n\nAFED made the observations at a press conference, held at a city hotel on Friday.\n\nFounder Chairperson of Democracywatch, Taleya Rehman and AFED spokesperson Harun-Or-Rashid addressed the press conference.\n\nWhile addressing, Harun-Or-Rashid said “Yesterday was an historic moment for us as citizens of Bangladesh. After many years, voters were able to cast their ballots in a peaceful environment where candidates could compete. In much of the country, the day was marked by a calm and festive atmosphere.”\n\nOn Election Day, AFED noted that the opening and voting was organised in an orderly manner. Polling stations were set up to protect the secrecy of the vote. Party and candidate agents were present throughout the day, which contributed to transparency.\n\nAFED saw just a few minor incidents of the voting process being interrupted. Closing and counting similarly followed established procedures, and in a vast majority of observed polling stations AFED observed no interference in the process.\n\nThe results of the parliamentary elections were publicly posted in over 95 percent of the polling centers observed, promoting transparency.\n\n“The Election Commission’s 785,225 polling officials worked tirelessly at the polling stations throughout the day. The presence and behaviour of law enforcement agencies ensured a safe environment. Political parties and candidates showed responsibility and commitment to the process. And last but not least voters waited patiently for their turn to cast the ballot”, Harun added\n\nHe said AFED noted that whilst election observers from their network were largely free to observe the opening and the voting, one fifth of their teams faced challenges to access polling centres at the stage of the counting. This undermined the transparency principle and should be addressed in future elections. “Now is the time to stay focused and see the process through to the end.\n\nWhile addressing, Taleya Rehman said AFED, the Alliance for Fair Election and Democracy, is a national platform of 30 reputable civil society organizations established ahead of the 2026 elections to conduct independent and non-partisan citizen election observation.\n\nShe said AFED deployed a more than 2.800 observers on Election Day. 175 Long-Term Observers will continue observing the post-election stage until 26 February 2026.\n\nAFED election observation activities are supported by funding from the European Union.

The potential of Bangladesh’s home textile industry is immense, but the sector is still struggling to grow at the desired pace due to multiple challenges, especially cost disadvantages.\n\nTalking to Bangladesh Post Shaheen Masood Hasan briefed in detail about the prospects and challenges of the country’s home textile sector, also recommended how to catch up the world market and survive in the global competition.\n\nThe excerpts of her interview is as bellows:\n\nBangladesh Post: How would you describe ACS Textiles and Towel Ltd. and its position in the global market?\n\nShaheen Hasan: ACS Textiles and Towel Ltd. is a proud symbol of British investment and world-class manufacturing excellence in Bangladesh. As a 100% export-oriented composite home textile facility, we are committed to delivering premium-quality products that meet the highest international standards across the United Kingdom, Europe, North America, Australia, Japan, the Middle East, and other global markets.\n\nOver the years, ACS has earned a strong reputation for trust, quality, and reliability. Our success is built on skilled manpower, modern technology, strict compliance, and an unwavering commitment to innovation. Today, we are proud that ACS is successfully competing with globally renowned soft furnishings producers from Portugal, Turkey, and Italy, who are widely recognized for their premium craftsmanship and excellence.\n\nBangladesh Post: Could you please introduce yourself to our readers?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Thank you. I am Shaheen Masood Hasan, Deputy Managing Director of ACS Textiles and Towel Ltd., a 100% export-oriented composite home textile manufacturing facility and a proud symbol of British investment in Bangladesh. I represent the next generation of leadership in Bangladesh’s home textile industry and am honored to carry forward the legacy of my father, Masood Dawood Akbani, one of the pioneers of the home textile sector in Bangladesh, with over 40 years of experience in building and shaping this industry.\n\nBangladesh Post: Bangladesh is known as a global leader in garments. How do you view the country’s home textile industry today?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Bangladesh has certainly achieved global leadership in garments and apparel manufacturing. However, our presence in the home textile sector remains significantly lower compared to key competitors such as India, Pakistan, and China, despite having highly skilled and hardworking workers.\n\nThe potential of Bangladesh’s home textile industry is immense, but the sector is still struggling to grow at the desired pace due to multiple challenges, especially cost disadvantages.\n\nBangladesh Post: What are the main challenges holding the home textile industry back?\n\nShaheen Hasan: One of the biggest barriers is the cost disadvantage. Gas prices in Bangladesh are significantly higher compared to competitor countries. Borrowing costs are extremely high, and bank interest rates often reach around 15 percent. Additionally, as fully compliant manufacturers, maintaining international compliance requires significant additional investment.\n\nAt the same time, countries like India and Pakistan continue to provide strong incentives and policy support, allowing them to remain highly competitive. Bangladesh previously had incentive support, but in recent times it has reduced significantly, making survival and competitiveness more challenging for export-oriented manufacturers.\n\nBangladesh Post: What type of government policy support do you believe is necessary?\n\nShaheen Hasan: To ensure long-term sustainability and survival of Bangladesh’s home textile industry, strong policy support is essential. Competitiveness today depends not only on manufacturing quality but also on strategic national support systems that help industries remain export-ready and overcome cost pressure.\n\nMany leading textile-producing nations provide support through export subsidies and cash incentives, stimulus packages during market instability, easier access to financing and export credit facilities, reduced borrowing costs, and supportive regulatory environments.\n\nBangladesh must adopt similar strategic measures. It is important that concerned government departments conduct comparative studies on competitor countries and implement practical solutions that make doing business easier. Without this support, Bangladesh risks losing market share in an increasingly competitive global industry.\n\nBangladesh Post: How does raw material dependency affect the industry?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Raw material dependency is another major challenge. Most manufacturers in Bangladesh must import yarn, chemicals, dyes, and packaging materials. Competitor countries such as India have strong backward linkage industries, including their own yarn production, which reduces cost and improves supply chain stability.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bangladesh remains capable of producing superior-quality products due to its skilled workforce and commitment to compliance. However, unless cost disadvantages are addressed through policy support, growth will remain limited compared to regional competitors.\n\nBangladesh Post: How important are innovation and design development in today’s market?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Innovation and design are extremely important. Buyer preferences evolve constantly, and variation and newness in design are essential to remain competitive. At ACS Textiles and Towel Ltd., innovation is one of our strongest pillars.\n\nWe believe design development is no longer an optional advantage—it is a necessity. That is why we have invested in global design support through three dedicated international design studios, each bringing unique market insight and creative direction.\n\nBangladesh Post: Could you tell us about ACS’s international design studios?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Certainly. We have three international design houses that support our product innovation and development. Sleepinn – Manchester, United Kingdom focuses on trend forecasting, seasonal color stories, and lifestyle-driven collections aligned with UK and Western market preferences. COS – Scandinavian & European Designers supports us with modern luxury-inspired collections, based on Scandinavian design principles such as minimalism, elegance, and refined aesthetics. MOSS – Melbourne, Australia focuses on contemporary design, bold pattern development, and innovative styling concepts aligned with global consumer trends.\n\nTogether, these design houses ensure ACS continues to deliver innovation and trend-driven product development in line with global buyer expectations.\n\nBangladesh Post: What are ACS’s key strengths in manufacturing and production capacity?\n\nShaheen Hasan: ACS operates as a modern composite manufacturing facility with weaving, dyeing, printing, finishing, and packaging under one roof. Our infrastructure supports large-scale production while maintaining premium quality standards.\n\nOur factory employs over 6,000 people and produces approximately 30,000 pieces of superior-quality textile products per day. We operate with over 550 Airjet looms, supported by advanced design facilities and digital printing capabilities. We also maintain multiple quality assurance labs throughout production to ensure strict quality control and consistency.\n\nBangladesh Post: Sustainability is becoming a major global concern. How is ACS addressing environmental responsibility?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Sustainability is a key focus for ACS. We believe responsible and sustainable industrial practices are essential for a future-ready textile industry. Our environmental responsibility is supported through in-house power generation, a fully functional Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), and a sludge management process aligned with national and international environmental policies. Sustainability is not only important for compliance, but also for long-term industry growth and responsibility.\n\nBangladesh Post: Is there potential for growth in Bangladesh’s local home textile market?\n\nShaheen Hasan: Yes, there is strong potential. Currently, large volumes of home textile products are imported from India and China. Bangladesh has the capability to produce high-quality products for the local market as well.\n\nHowever, as an export-oriented bonded warehouse facility, we face restrictions in selling domestically. With supportive policies and proper facilitation, Bangladesh could reduce dependency on imports and strengthen local home textile development, benefiting consumers and the national economy.\n\nBangladesh Post: How important are international exhibitions like Heimtextil for your business?\n\nShaheen Hasan: International exhibitions are extremely important.

    "body": "Journalists on Thursday issued a 72-hour ultimatum demanding the arrest of all those involved in an attack on reporters in front of Dream Holiday Park in Narsingdi, warning of tougher programmes if law enforcers fail to act within the deadline.\n\nThe ultimatum was announced by the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) during a human chain and protest rally organised at the premises of the Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) on Thursday noon.\n\nCRAB President Mirza Mehedi Tamal said police must immediately review CCTV footage of the incident and publish photographs of the named accused within 24 hours. “All accused must be arrested within 72 hours. Failure to do so will compel us to announce a broader movement, including demands for the removal of the Narsingdi superintendent of police and the officer-in-charge of Madhabdi Police Station,” he said.\n\nHe also announced that memorandums would be submitted to the home affairs adviser and the inspector general of police, protesting what he described as administrative negligence and delayed police response.\n\nLeaders of various journalist bodies, including the Dhaka Journalists Union, National Press Club, Law Reporters Forum, Bangladesh Secretariat Reporters Forum, Defence Journalists Association of Bangladesh, Reporters Against Corruption, Political Reporters Forum and Dhaka Medical Reporters Association, expressed solidarity with CRAB.\n\nDUJ President Shahidul Islam alleged that those responsible for the attack were known extortionists and criticised the police for what he termed a lack of visible action. He claimed that delays in responding to the incident had allowed suspects to flee and demanded accountability from senior police officials.\n\nCRAB General Secretary MM Badshah said that despite video and CCTV evidence, arrests had not been made promptly. “This delay is not just negligence; it raises serious questions about the role of law enforcement,” he said.\n\nSeveral speakers also demanded an investigation into whether the Dream Holiday Park authorities had any connection with the attackers, saying responsibility could not be avoided.\n\nOn January 26, local criminals allegedly attacked a bus carrying CRAB members who were heading to a picnic near Dream Holiday Park, reportedly demanding extortion money. At least 10 journalists were injured in the attack, four of them critically.\n\nThe injured journalists received treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Narsingdi Sadar Hospital and are now recovering at home. A case has been filed with Madhabdi Police Station in connection with the incident.",

    "body": "It sounds alarming that there is still no sign of getting respite from the soaring prices of essential commodities as the government, despite its efforts, cannot contain the price hike. People, particularly the low and fixed income group, are bearing the brunt of unusual increase in the prices of essentials. Sufferings of this section of people know no bounds as almost all the essential items excepting a few winter vegetables are selling at exorbitant prices across the country.\n\nAmid the ongoing market situation, prices of sugar, edible oils and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) have increased further, dealing a fresh blow to the consumers ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. The Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has demanded that the government take effective measures to tame price hike of essential commodities.\n\nThe CAB, in a statement on Saturday, accused an influential group of destabilising the sugar market by creating artificial crisis at the import, mill and supply levels through dirty syndication and supply control. Increase in LPG, soybean oil and palm oil prices cannot be justified as it is directly inflating the daily cost of living for the people, it said. Sugar prices had been stable a week ago, but wholesale prices have sharply gone up with retail rates rising by Tk 10 per kilogram.\n\nThe CAB attributed the spike to a halt in white sugar imports and production, and supply shortfall at mill level and alleged that a section of traders again is manipulating prices ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, an unethical practice they do every year.\n\nEdible oil prices have climbed in recent weeks. Soybean and palm oil rose by Tk 5–10 per litre, and Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) data show retail bottled soybean oil prices have increased 12.85 percent over the past year.\n\nSome traders always cite international market conditions for the hike in prices of the items, but similar urgency is absent when prices decline, leaving consumers to bear one-sided price pressure. There is no valid reason for recent price hike of LPG or shortage. Some traders are charging well above government-fixed rates, citing rising demand, and possible manipulation by importers and distributors.\n\nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) sets prices of LPG, but it does not enforce them, thus allowing traders to routinely ignore official rates. Syndicates are exploiting administrative preoccupations ahead of Ramadan and other upcoming occasions. Current price hike reflects weak poor market monitoring. It is not linked to supply situation or international market trends.\n\nIf markets for essential commodities such as LPG, sugar, and edible oil remain in the hands of syndicates, consumers’ purchasing power will be eroded, and public confidence in the market system will weaken further.\n\nWe hope the government will take all necessary measures, such as strong market monitoring, to keep stable the prices of essentials to give relief to the people from the price spiral. Stern action should be also taken against syndicates and hoarders responsible for price hike.",

The deal is valued at 64.4 million Pakistani Rupees (approximately 28.1 million Bangladeshi Taka).\n\nMustafizur’s release from KKR triggered a domino effect that has since fractured the region's cricketing ties.\n\nFollowing Mustafizur's exclusion, the Bangladesh government refused to send the national team to India for the T20 World Cup due to safety concerns. After the ICC rejected a venue change request and replaced Bangladesh with Scotland, the Pakistan government announced a boycott of their World Cup match against India in solidarity with Dhaka.\n\nWelcoming Mustafizur back, the Lahore Qalandars described the signing as a “return to the family,” referring to his previous stint with the team during the 2017-18 season.\n\nThe 11th edition of the PSL, which has expanded to eight teams this year, is scheduled to run from March 26 to May 3. While the player draft is set for February 11, the Qalandars utilized the direct signing rule to secure Mustafizur’s services early.",

We should fully stand by Bangladesh. I think this is a very appropriate decision.”\n\nThe diplomatic sporting row stems from the International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland in the tournament.\n\nThe Bangladesh government had refused to send their team to India citing security concerns, following threats from communal groups that led to pacer Mustafizur Rahman being dropped from the IPL on January 3.\n\nWhile the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) requested a venue change to Sri Lanka, the ICC rejected the plea, labeling the threat against Mustafizur as “isolated.” Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul later said that neither the ICC nor the Indian government provided necessary security assurances.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi has supported Bangladesh throughout the process, criticizing the ICC for “double standards” regarding security protocols.\n\nThe T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, begins on February 7.

A PCB source said chairman Mohsin Naqvi had consulted the board’s legal team before briefing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the matter last week, but the board is now preparing for serious repercussions.\n\n“If Pakistan does not back down and play against India, they could face heavy financial penalties, a possible lawsuit from broadcasters, and even an appeal to the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee is unlikely to succeed,” the source told PTI.\n\nThe ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee is an internal body that does not entertain appeals against decisions taken by the ICC Board itself.\n\nAnother PCB source pointed out that Pakistan’s position could be further weakened because the team is already playing all its matches at a neutral venue in Sri Lanka, a condition it had sought instead of playing in India.\n\nThe source also noted that while the Indian government has not allowed its team to tour Pakistan, it has not prevented India from playing Pakistan at neutral venues in Asia Cup or ICC tournaments, even after the conflict in May.\n\nThe PCB has not yet sent a written communication to the ICC, though the boycott is reportedly being viewed as an act of solidarity with Bangladesh following their ouster.\n\n“When the ICC signed a four-year broadcasting deal for its events, India-Pakistan matches were a key component of that contract, and payments were made accordingly,” the source said.\n\n“As a result, the broadcaster would be well within its rights to take both the PCB and the ICC to court over what it sees as a major breach of contract.”",

    "body": "We are deeply concerned about a media report that children are increasingly falling victim to rape, murder and various other forms of violence across the country. Acts of violence against children have become a common phenomenon in the country. It sounds paradoxical when we talk about advancement of the country by making the children as worthy citizens, as this horrible picture of child rights stands in the way of the country’s overall development.\n\nA nation is bound to plunge into darkness and it can never see the light of prosperity if children remain unsafe and unprotected. Development of a country is simply impossible without ensuring rights for the children.\n\nAccording to a study, children are facing serious safety threats in the country as incidents of rape, murder and various forms of abuse continue to rise. The study findings were unveiled in a research report titled ‘State of Child Rights 2025’. The report says, of the 1,867 negative news items related to children, 1,170 reports involved cases of child rape and murder.\n\nSachetan Sangstha with support from the Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF) and the Street Children Activists Network (SCAN) Bangladesh conducted the study based on the reports published in media.\n\nIt is a shame for the nation that we cannot protect the children— the future leaders of the country— from violence. We cannot think of proper development of the country unless we create a safe abode for the children.\n\nPresenting the key findings, SCAN General Secretary Moniruzzaman Mukul stressed the need for firm political commitment to ensuring rights of children. All political parties contesting the upcoming national election must include clear and specific pledges to ensure child rights in their poll manifestos, he added.\n\nHe also called for strict enforcement of law and political consensus to keep children away from political violence, along with speedy trial and exemplary punishment for those involved in child rape and murder.\n\nLack of coordination among government and non-government initiatives are blamed for the rise in violence against children, Bangladesh Shishu Academy Director General Arju Ara Begum said and also sought greater media cooperation in ensuring child protection.\n\nAlthough the government and non-government organisations (NGOs) are working with some positive steps to ensure rights of children, violence against children, particularly sexual abuse still remains alarming.\n\nEffective enforcement of laws, increased awareness at family and community levels and creation of a child-friendly education system can play a vital role in ensuring protection of children of the country.\n\nWe hope the government and the agencies concerned will take all necessary measures to protect children from any form of violence by creating a safe and healthy environment for them.",

To prevent political meddling in the future, this approval is essential. We need a modern central banking system backed by law,” he said.\n\nDr Mansur also addressed concerns about Bangladesh’s upcoming graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. While some business leaders have suggested delaying the transition to manage economic challenges, the governor rejected such calls, citing Bangladesh’s strong performance across development indicators.\n\n“We should not compare Bangladesh with countries like Somalia, South Sudan, or Afghanistan. Every development index, including GDP, shows we are far ahead. Staying in the LDC group is not a matter of honor for us anymore. The nation’s goal should be to join the ranks of developing countries like Malaysia or India to gain global respect. We cannot sacrifice long-term gains for minor, short-term benefits.”\n\nThe governor also criticised the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) and other trade bodies for past inaction during episodes of money laundering and the controversial ‘6–9 percent’ interest rate cap.\n\n“Business organisations have behaved like puppets in the past. They cheered for the 6–9 percent interest rate and remained silent when money was being siphoned out of the country. Democracy can never be strengthened if such behavior continues,” Dr Mansur said.\n\nDuring the discussion, AK Azad, Vice President of ICC Bangladesh and Chairman of Ha-Meem Group, expressed concerns over the country’s current contractionary monetary policy, claiming that rising interest rates have already resulted in 1.2 million job losses, with another 1.2 million potentially at risk in the next six months.\n\nDr Mansur acknowledged that interest rates are high but attributed the situation to $20 billion being siphoned out of the country, which contributed to a rise in non-performing loans (NPLs).\n\nHe said once governance improves and inflation is brought under control, interest rates are expected to ease.\n\nThe International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh (ICCB) organised the event, with its president Mahbubur Rahman moderating and economic analysts, policymakers and business leaders in attendance.",

In a nutshell, people are absolutely hostage to an anarchic situation and it seems almost impossible to get out of this rot shortly.\n\nVoicing concerns over worsening road safety experts said that the operation of a large number of unfit vehicles, a shortage of skilled drivers, a sharp rise in small and slow-moving vehicles, and poor enforcement of traffic laws have plunged the transport sector into disarray. Rash driving and break-neck dash of vehicles are often responsible for accidents. Respect for laws is hardly seen among the drivers.\n\nUntil the change of government following last year’s mass uprising, it is learnt that a number of key committees or task forces had been entrusted with overseeing road safety. But none of these committees, so far it is known, performed anything significant. There had been a National road Safety Action Plan for reducing road crashes, which, though never effectively implemented, expired last December. And the roads remain deadly and road crashes keep rising. Experts said severe shortcomings in strategic transport planning and the failure to address indiscipline led to sharp rise in road crashes and fatalities under the previous government. Strategies of the ministry of road transport and bridges, and traffic police division have remained largely unchanged. As a result, there has been no visible progress in curbing road accidents. The Road Transport Act 2018 has also failed to address the prevailing indiscipline in the sector as it remains largely unimplemented. The authorities’ failure to enforce its directive to withdraw longevity-expired vehicles from operation is a case in point. This situation must change altogether.\n\nThe surge in the number of injury-related deaths also highlights a public health crisis that demands a quick response. The authorities must develop and execute an injury prevention strategy, form a national committee for necessary interventions, and build capacity for on-site injury prevention. Against this backdrop, all including political parties must commit to prioritizing road safety as road crashes remain a major cause of deaths and injuries, and modernising public transport systems to ensure safe roads for all.",

    "body": "Rising before dawn, heading to the garment factory, working to the constant hum of machines and fixed schedules – this is the everyday reality for thousands of garment workers in Bangladesh. But even in the middle of busy workdays, people look for moments of joy, rest, and time together. Keeping that in mind, at the beginning of each year, Hop Lun gently breaks this familiar rhythm. For a few days, the company organizes its annual picnic, where work uniforms give way to colorful smiles and fatigue is replaced by joy.\n\nStepping away from work pressure, tight schedules, and daily routines, this year’s annual picnic brought together 20,000 employees from Hop Lun’s eight factories across Bangladesh, turning a simple outing into a special gathering of connection and renewal.\n\nSpread across multiple days and paid for entirely by the company, the event ensured that everyone had a chance to join – regardless of which factory they worked at or what shift they were on. It was meant to provide workers with a mental break before the busy year begins.\n\nFor many workers, stepping away from factory floors into a festive open space brought an immediate emotional change. The day was packed with fun – cultural shows, games, shared meals – all creating moments where people connect as humans, not just coworkers. When top executives sit and eat alongside factory workers, something shifts. Walls come down. Understanding grows.\n\n“People are the strength of Hop Lun,” said Nishanth Mohottige, Country Head of Hop Lun Bangladesh. “This is our way of showing care and respect towards them. When employees feel happy, refreshed, and valued, they return to work with a stronger focus and commitment. We believe this approach sets an example for the RMG sector in Bangladesh.”\n\nFor Sabina Akter, an operator at Hop Lun Apparel Limited, the picnic was more than just a day of fun. She said, “We work throughout the year without taking a break from our regular routine. But at the picnic, we could forget about work for a while. We're all equal here, just enjoying ourselves. It makes me so proud to work somewhere that actually cares.” To most employees like Sabina, it isn’t simply about a day out. It’s about getting appreciated and feeling that they truly matter.\n\nAt last, as the buses headed back to the factories, the stress of the previous year was gone, replaced by a sense of belonging and shared spark of enthusiasm for the months ahead.",

    "body": "Planning Adviser Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud on Sunday said the government is moving away from financing large-scale development projects through foreign loans and stressed the need for avoiding a ‘debt trap’.\n\n“We do not want to take loans for big projects unnecessarily. Institutions like the World Bank often come with many project proposals. If some are genuinely high priority, we may consider them. But these issues are now being discussed and assessed very carefully,” he told reporters after an ECNEC meeting.\n\nThe adviser said the government will accept loan-funded projects only if they are of critical national priority and cannot be financed or implemented with domestic resources or expertise.\n\nHe noted that some initiatives such as pollution monitoring do not justify large loans or foreign consultants.\n\n“Measuring pollution is not that difficult. The instruments involved are not extraordinarily complex. There is no need to take large foreign loans for such purposes,” he said.\n\nHe added that as Bangladesh prepares for LDC graduation, interest rates on foreign loans are rising, making them more expensive and underscored the importance of relying on domestic capacity.\n\nThe adviser also warned against attractive but unnecessary projects offered by multilateral lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\n“We will take only those loan projects that are truly necessarywhere foreign support is genuinely required. Everything else should be done with our own resources, even if on a smaller scale,” he said.\n\nHe also highlighted the government’s intention to reduce long-standing dependence on loans in social sectors, including education.\n\n“There is no point in becoming trapped in a vicious cycle of debt. We want to move away from heavy reliance on loans in all sectors,” he added.",

    "body": "Bangladesh’s state-owned commercial banks have the capacity to expand lending but continue to lag in timely loan recovery, said central bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur on Monday, underscoring a key structural weakness in the country’s banking system.\n\nSpeaking at Sonali Bank’s Annual Conference 2026 in Dhaka, Dr Mansur said weak borrower selection remains a major factor behind rising defaults, adding that improving credit appraisal is essential to keeping loans from turning non-performing.\n\nYears of tight regulatory controls have made state banks excessively cautious, constraining credit growth and limiting their contribution to the broader economy, the Governor said.\n\nWhile such caution was once necessary, he pointed out, an excessively restrictive lending model, similar to that seen before 2000, is incompatible with the needs of a modern economy.\n\n“If a bank mobilises deposits but fails to play an effective role in the macroeconomy, its success remains limited,” Mansur said, urging Sonali Bank to move beyond its conservative approach and expand lending more assertively.\n\nHe pointed to a wide gap between Bangladesh’s banking sector and global peers, particularly in consumer and housing finance, where state-owned banks have so far played only a marginal role despite strong market potential.\n\nDr Mansur called on Sonali Bank to transform itself into a ‘full-fledged commercial bank’ operating strictly on commercial principles, a shift he said is necessary to ensure long-term profitability.\n\nOn the bank’s financial position, the Governor highlighted several positive developments.\n\nProfits earned last year will be used to cover capital and provisioning shortfalls, he said, expressing confidence that Sonali Bank could eventually resume dividend payments.\n\nThe bank’s non-performing loan ratio has already fallen below 18%, according to Mansur, who said the figure could decline further if the bank increases high-quality lending.\n\nHe also said the government plans to give Sonali Bank greater operational autonomy, allowing it to function on commercial considerations, and a policy direction, he hopes, future governments will maintain.\n\nDr Mansur urged Sonali Bank to step up efforts to attract remittances, strengthen support for exporters and identify capable small and medium-sized enterprise borrowers at the grassroots level, saying these areas will be critical to both the bank’s performance and the country’s economic growth.",

    "body": "BSS, Gazipur: Bhawal Garh, spread across the Shal forest region of Gazipur district, remains a unique testimony to the history, tradition and folklore of Bengal, reflecting centuries of political power, cultural development and legendary events.\n\nOnce covered with dense Shal, Ghazari and Karai forests, Bhawal Garh encompassed parts of present-day Gazipur Sadar, Sreepur, Kaliakoir and Kapasia upazilas. Owing to its elevated and naturally protected terrain, the area historically served as a secure administrative centre and later emerged as one of the richest zamindaris (landowners) of Bengal.\n\nHistorians said that Bhawal Pargana gained prominence during the Mughal era, particularly under Emperor Akbar, when it became an important centre of revenue collection following the introduction of a modern tax system. Earlier, the region was ruled by the Ghazi family, including Daulat Ghazi, before passing into the hands of Hindu rulers such as Balaram and later Kali Narayan.\n\nThe Bhawal zamindari was formally established in the late 17th century. Its capital, the Bhawal Rajbari-constructed between 1870 and 1880-still stands as a striking architectural landmark. Built in a blend of European and Mughal styles, the palace reportedly contains 365 rooms. Other notable structures include the Nat Temple inside the palace complex, Bhawal Raj Dighi, and the cremation math temple nearby.\n\nSenior journalist Rezaul Bari Babul of Gazipur told BSS that administrative activities of Bhawal Garh revolved around the Rajbari area, where the district administration is now located. \"The huge Raj Dighi was excavated to enhance both security and aesthetic beauty,\" he said.\n\nAM Ashraf Hossain, secretary of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, Gazipur Unit said Bhawal Pargana once generated significant revenue for the Mughal administration. \"With proper planning, the remaining resources of Bhawal Pargana could still contribute to national welfare,\" he added, expressing concern over the gradual decay of historical sites.\n\nOne of the most sensational episodes associated with Bhawal Garh is the Bhawal Sanyasi case. In 1930, a monk claimed to be Ramendra Narayan Roy, the second Bhawal Raja believed to have died years earlier, and filed a lawsuit seeking recognition as the rightful heir to the Bhawal estate. The case, contested by Rani Bibhavati Devi, became one of the longest and most dramatic legal battles during British rule in India.\n\nToday, parts of the once-vast forest have been preserved as Bhawal National Park, while folk tales of saints, robbers and heroic figures continue to enrich local culture through songs, processions and oral traditions.\n\nDespite its growing popularity as a tourist destination, many historical structures in Bhawal Garh face deterioration due to inadequate conservation.\n\nLocal residents and heritage activists have called on the government to declare Bhawal Garh a national heritage site and undertake systematic preservation efforts.",

    "title": "Khaleda Zia’s passing: Country loses a guardian in political arena",
    "body": "The death of Begum Khaleda Zia, three-time Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), marks the end of one of the most influential and defining chapters in the political history of Bangladesh. At the age of 80, she breathed her last on Tuesday morning. Her life and legacy are deeply intertwined with the country’s democratic struggle, political rivalry, policy initiatives, and decades of polarization. Her departure is not merely the passing of a leader—it is the closure of an era shaped by a woman who defined and redefined Bangladesh’s politics for more than four decades.\n\nKhaleda Zia’s political journey was extraordinary. Born in 1945 in Dinajpur, she entered politics after the assassination of her husband, President Ziaur Rahman, in 1981. What began as an unwilling entry gradually transformed into solid leadership. She became Chairperson of the BNP in 1984 and in 1991 assumed office as the country’s first female Prime Minister—an epoch-making milestone in the political history of Bangladesh and South Asia.\n\nHer first administration is remembered for significant reforms in education—free and compulsory primary education, stipends for female students, and the Food for Education program that opened doors for millions of underprivileged children. She played a role in restoring the parliamentary form of government through the 12th Amendment. Her government initiated the construction of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge and strengthened regional diplomacy by hosting the SAARC Summit in Dhaka in 1993.\n\nBut the road she walked was never free of challenges. The BNP–Awami League rivalry intensified street politics for decades—movements, election-related disputes, boycotts, and nationwide confrontations shaped the political climate. To her supporters, she was a determined leader; to her critics, a figure of contention. Yet, she was undeniably central to Bangladesh’s politics throughout her life.\n\nDuring her third term in office (2001–2006), export earnings grew, remittance inflow surged, and the telecommunications sector expanded rapidly. Her government took stern initiatives on law and order, including forming specialized units, and its counter-terrorism actions drew notable attention. Corruption allegations emerged later—which her party and followers continuously rejected as politically motivated—and these cases overshadowed her later political life. Nevertheless, court verdicts eventually declared her innocent. Despite arrests, trials, imprisonment, and deteriorating health, she remained unyielding. In 2017, despite the risk of imprisonment, she chose to return home instead of staying abroad—a reflection of strength and conviction.\n\nIn her final years, illness frequently took her back to the hospital. Released in 2020 on humanitarian grounds, she was long denied permission for treatment abroad. After the political change in 2024, she regained full freedom. Though physically frail, her presence remained symbolic—an embodiment of resistance, memory, and history. Time and again, she emerged as a symbol of anti-autocracy movements and resistance to external dominance, standing for democracy, independence, and sovereignty.\n\nHer passing leaves a political void—an emotional one for her followers, and a symbolic one for the nation. The long-standing rivalry between the two female leaders—Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina—has shaped the country’s political culture for generations. It is also worth noting that she never resorted to personal slander against her political opponents. As the nation mourns today, a question emerges alongside grief—can Bangladesh now move toward a more tolerant, less confrontational politics?\n\nHistory will debate Khaleda Zia, but it will not forget her. She will be remembered as a symbol of democratic struggle, resilience, and political endurance. The loss is irreparable not only for her supporters but for Bangladesh itself. She was a guardian during turbulent times—her voice influential, relevant, and a witness to the making of history.\n\nShe will be remembered. And her legacy will continue to inspire—guiding the nation toward democracy, tolerance, and progress.\n\nSent from my iPhone",

He warned that no vested quarter should be allowed to exploit the situation to create instability.\n\nReferring to the participation of 51 political parties in the Jatiya Sangsad elections — including Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, National Citizen Party, Islami Andolan Bangladesh, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and Gono Odhikar Parishad — he congratulated all democratic parties that took part in the polls, saying that their ideas would be valued in the nation-building process.\n\nAccording to the results of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections and the simultaneous constitutional referendum held in 299 constituencies on Thursday, the BNP secured 209 JS seats while the Jamaat won 68.\n\nThe BNP chief stressed that without establishing the rule of law, all efforts would be in vain.\n\nThe law must apply equally to every citizen — whether in the government or in the opposition — and its enforcement must strictly follow due process, he affirmed.\n\nHe described political parties as the beacon of democracy, saying that both the government and the opposition must act responsibly from their respective positions to institutionalise democratic practices.\n\n‘Our paths and opinions may differ but in the matters of national interest we are united,’ he said, adding ‘National unity is the country’s strength while division is its weakness.’\n\nHe identified the depoliticisation of institutions, economic recovery, public security and the establishment of good governance as key challenges ahead.\n\nLegal procedures would be followed to ensure the trial of fallen dictator Sheikh Hasina, he said, pledging efforts to revitalise the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\n\nTarique thanked the interim government and the Election Commission for holding a free, fair and peaceful election, saying that their contribution would be remembered in the history of the country’s democracy.\n\nPaying tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the movements from the 1971 Liberation War to the July uprising in 2024 in defence of the country’s independence and democratic rights, he expressed profound respect to the martyrs.\n\nHe said that their blood had paved the way for today’s democratic Bangladesh.\n\nThe BNP, Tarique reminded, had announced its manifesto based on a 31-point outline and also signed the July National Charter with notes of dissent on certain issues.\n\nHe pledged that the party would implement its commitments to the people in phases.\n\nCalling the moment one of great joy for party leaders, activists and democracy-loving citizens, he said that the absence of party chairperson Khaleda Zia cast a pall of gloom over the celebrations.\n\nTarique said that Khaleda Zia who died on December 30, 2025, had waged an uncompromising struggle against authoritarianism in pursuit of democratic rights.\n\nAcknowledging that misunderstandings might have arisen during the election campaign, he urged all sides to make sure that electoral rivalry did not turn into will for revenge or hostility.\n\nTarique called for unity in combating corruption, maintaining law and order and ensuring accountability to the public.\n\nIn the journey to rebuild the nation, he said, every citizen must play a responsible role.\n\nThe BNP chair hoped for cooperation from all parties and opinions in establishing a safe, humane, and democratic Bangladesh.\n\nResponding to a question on the foreign policy of the BNP, particularly in relation to neighbouring countries, including India, Tarique said the party’s position was clear: Bangladesh’s national interest and the interests of its people would come first.\n\nHe said that foreign policy decisions would be guided by the need to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and welfare.\n\nBNP standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury supplemented that the party did not pursue any country-centric approach.\n\nInstead, he added, Bangladesh’s foreign policy would be based on mutual respect, mutual interest, non-interference, and strategic autonomy, principles that would apply uniformly to all countries.\n\nAsked about the verdict of the International Crimes Tribunal against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on charges of crimes against humanity, Tarique said the matter rested with the judiciary.\n\nDuring the press conference, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said that the election marked a victory for liberal democracy.\n\nHe said that the people had voted for change — change for development, change in prevailing conditions, change in politics and a transformation towards the democratisation of the economy.",

The President is spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. | AFP photo.\n\nFormer United States president Barack Obama criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys.\n\nIn a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama also compared the actions of agents enforcing the president’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to dictatorships.\n\nThe video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting ‘fake outrage’ only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.\n\nNear the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history — were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.\n\n‘The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,’ Cohen said in the interview.\n\n‘And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?’\n\nWithout naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans ‘find this behavior deeply troubling.’\n\n‘There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.’\n\nObama predicted such messaging will hurt Trump’s Republicans in midterm elections, that ‘ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people.’\n\nTrump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.\n\nTurning to Trump’s policies, Obama criticised his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week.\n\nObama called the behavior of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump’s mass crackdown, as the sort that ‘in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships.’\n\nThousands of federal agents — including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement — carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals.\n\n‘The rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,’ Obama said.\n\nBut he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.\n\n‘Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way, citizens saying, ‘this is not the America we believe in,’ and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,’ he said.\n\n‘That kind of heroic, sustained behavior in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope.\n\n‘As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.’\n\nThe aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nDemocrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.",

    "body": "Two people were killed and three others suffered critical injuries in an explosion while allegedly making crude bombs at a house at Fatapara village under Charbagdanga union at Chapainawabganj Sadar upazila early Saturday.\n\nHowever, the police could not confirm the identity of the two deceased till Saturday evening as their faces were severely burned in the blast.\n\nThe injured were identified as Md Shuvo, 22, of Ghorastand village, Minhaj Uddin, 30, of Charbagdanga, and Bazlur Rahman, 19. All three were undergoing treatment at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital on Saturday.\n\nRMCH spokesperson Dr Shankar Kumar Biswas told New Age that the injured suffered facial burn injuries but were in stable condition.\n\n‘They have been admitted to separate wards and are undergoing treatment under police supervision. Their physical condition is stable,’ he said.\n\nFamily members said that the explosion took place inside a house belonging to a relative.\n\nMd Ketabul Islam, elder brother of injured Bazlur Rahman, said that family members woke up after hearing a loud explosion at dawn.\n\n‘Later we rescued Bazlur Rahman from the debris in an injured condition,’ he said, adding that the house where the explosion occurred belonged to his uncle, and his brother had gone there to sleep at night.\n\nAfter the explosion, the house owner, Kalam Ali, went into absconding.\n\nFowzia Khatun, mother of injured Shuvo, said that her son, a tractor driver and a construction labourer, left home at about 10:00pm on Friday, saying that he was going to attend a picnic.\n\n‘He initially did not want to go as he was feeling unwell. But, he went after receiving repeated phone calls,’ she said, adding that she came to know about the incident after Shuvo was taken to the hospital and she rushed there.\n\nMohammad Shahjahan, deputy inspector general of Rajshahi Range police, told New Age that the circumstances suggested that the victims were preparing crude bombs when the explosion occurred.\n\nHe said that the blast caused parts of the brick walls to collapse and blew off the tin-shed roof of the house.\n\nMembers of the Criminal Investigation Department had collected evidence from the scene, he said, adding that police would conduct a special drive in the area on Saturday night.\n\n‘Although we do not expect such incidents after the elections, we cannot rule out the possibility. The police are taking measures to prevent any recurrence,’ he said.\n\nThe police official also said that no immediate evidence of political affiliation had been found and that a comprehensive investigation was under way to determine the source of the explosive materials.\n\nChapainawabganj superintendent of police Goutom Kumar Biswas told New Age that police had received two possible names of the deceased from locals but could not verify them with family members.\n\n‘We will disclose their identities once confirmed. A case is being filed with the Chapainawabganj Sadar police station in this connection,’ he said.\n\nMeanwhile, BNP-backed defeated candidate for the Chapainawabganj-3 constituency Harun-ur-Rashid alleged that activists of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami with the support of members of banned Awami League, had been preparing explosives to attack BNP supporters, but the devices exploded prematurely.\n\nHe urged law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough investigation to identify those behind the incident.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies had earlier recovered a huge amount of crude bombs and explosive-making materials from different areas of Chapainawabganj ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections held on February 12.",

    "body": "The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association today extended heartfelt congratulations to BNP chairman Tarique Rahman on the party’s historic landslide victory in the 13th National Parliamentary Election.\n\nIn a congratulatory message, BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan lauded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party for securing more than a two-thirds majority in the polls under the ‘unique and visionary leadership’ of Tarique Rahman.\n\n‘On behalf of BGMEA, I convey our sincere and heartfelt congratulations to you and to leaders and activists of all levels of the party for this unprecedented and sweeping victory,’ the message said.\n\nThe association described the electoral mandate as a reflection of the people’s aspirations for safeguarding democratic continuity and building a prosperous and equitable Bangladesh. It termed the outcome an ‘unforgettable milestone’ in the nation’s democratic journey.\n\nExpressing confidence in the new leadership, the BGMEA president said the dynamic and bold leadership of Tarique Rahman would help position Bangladesh as a respected and strong economic force on the global stage.\n\nReferring to the country’s ready-made garment (RMG) sector as the backbone of the national economy, BGMEA noted that the industry currently stands at a critical juncture in its development trajectory.\n\nThe association underscored the importance of visionary policy support and a business-friendly approach from the new government to address post-LDC graduation challenges, ensure uninterrupted energy security, and consolidate Bangladesh’s competitive position in the global apparel market.\n\n‘The RMG sector is facing multifaceted global challenges following Bangladesh’s graduation from the LDC category. Ensuring sustainable growth will require pragmatic policy measures, stable energy supply and strategic trade support,’ the message added.\n\nThe BGMEA expressed strong optimism that with the full support and guidance of the new government, the sector would be able to realize its national target of increasing garment exports to US$100 billion by 2030. It also voiced hope that under Tarique Rahman’s direction, the ‘Made in Bangladesh’ brand would further strengthen its global reputation as a symbol of excellence and resilience.\n\nThe association further congratulated BGMEA members who were elected Members of Parliament with overwhelming public support in the recent election. It said their active participation in the Jatiya Sangsad would play a significant role in resolving sectoral challenges and strengthening the overall economy.\n\nThe BGMEA also expressed its expectation that the new government would establish a stable, innovative and robust economic framework where investors can operate with confidence and Bangladesh can advance toward greater economic prosperity.\n\nThe association concluded its message by wishing Tarique Rahman good health, longevity and continued success in leading the nation in the days ahead.",

Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal.’\n\nOther members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.\n\nThe foursome are replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station’s history.\n\nThe ISS, which orbits 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.\n\nNASA declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the previous mission short.\n\nCrew-12 will be one of the last crews to live aboard the football field-sized space station.\n\nContinuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the aging ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth’s orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.\n\nDuring their eight months on the outpost, the astronauts will conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies.\n\nMeir, who previously worked as a marine biologist studying animals in extreme environments, will serve as the crew’s commander.\n\nAdenot has become the second French woman to fly into space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station.\n\nAmong other research, she will test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds.\n\n‘I am proud to bring France and Europe along on this incredible adventure that transcends borders,’ Adenot said.\n\n‘Count on me to share every step with you and bring a sparkle to the eyes of the French people.’\n\nThe ISS, once a symbol of warming post-Cold War relations, has been a rare area of continued cooperation between the West and Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nHowever, the space station has not entirely avoided the tensions back on Earth.\n\nIn November, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev — who had long been planned to be a member of Crew-12 — was suddenly taken off the mission.\n\nReports from independent media in Russia suggested he had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone while training at a SpaceX facility. Russian space agency Roscosmos merely said he had been transferred to a different job.\n\nHis replacement, Fedyaev, has already spent some time on the ISS as part of Crew-6 in 2023.",

    "body": "Woman tying a garland of flower on her wrist on Phohela Phalgun at Shahbag flower market in Dhaka. | Focus Bangla photo\n\nFlower sales across the country fell sharply this Pahela Phalgun due to the long holiday during the 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections, traders reported on Saturday.\n\nAlthough Pahela Phalgun and Valentine’s Day coincided on 14 February, a rare overlap that sellers had hoped would double their earnings, the colourful celebrations failed to generate the expected commercial bloom.\n\nTraders said customer turnout was significantly lower than in previous years, with many residents still outside Dhaka following the polls.\n\nUniversity campuses, traditionally the epicentre of Phalgun festivities, also remained relatively quiet.\n\nEvery year, flower shops at Shahbagh witness overwhelming crowds ahead of the spring festival and Valentine’s Day.\n\nThis year, however, traders described the atmosphere as unusually subdued, with more onlookers than buyers.\n\nShops displayed locally grown roses, jasmine and marigolds, locally known as gondhoraj, along with other seasonal flowers, while lilies were selling at around Tk 500 each.\n\nAlthough the variety was abundant, traders said the number of buyers was noticeably lower than in previous years.\n\nAbul Kalam, president of the Bangladesh Small Flower Traders’ Association, told New Age that 55 registered sellers were operating at Shahbagh under the association’s banner.\n\nHe said a four-day break linked to the national election disrupted deliveries and affected overall supply.\n\n‘Dhaka is still relatively empty. That is why sales are not up to the mark like previous years,’ he said. ‘Many people are taking pictures, but few are buying.’\n\nHe added that total sales at the market could still approach around Tk 1 crore by the end of the day, but that would fall short of traders’ expectations and targets.\n\nHe expressed hope that business would rebound once the new parliament is formed and normal activities resume.\n\nMd Jamal Hossen, owner of New Love Line Pushpalaya at Shahbagh, said that in previous years, Pahela Phalgun and Valentine’s Day were observed on separate dates, allowing traders to benefit from two peak sales days.\n\n‘This year, we have only one day of business. If the days were separate, overall sales and profits would have been higher,’ he said.\n\nRed and multicoloured roses remained the top-selling flowers, but prices dropped sharply due to low footfall.\n\nRoses that usually sell for Tk 150 to Tk 180 on the day were being offered at Tk 50 to Tk 70 this year.\n\nFlowers are mainly supplied from Savar, Godkhali in Jashore, Chuadanga, Chattogram and Tangail, traders said.\n\nDespite the slowdown, Jamal expressed hope that individual shops at Shahbagh might still record sales exceeding Tk 100,000 by the end of the day.\n\nApart from roses, scentless jasmine garlands for women’s hair were selling at Tk 30 each, while fragrant jasmine ranged between Tk 100 and Tk 130.\n\nSome traders also alleged that content creators and mobile journalists had been crowding shop entrances since morning, making customers uncomfortable.\n\n‘Many customers hesitate to enter when they see cameras. Some have complained, while others do not want to face the camera,’ said a shopkeeper who preferred not to be named.\n\nStill, a few buyers made their way to the market.\n\nRobiul Awal Robin, a government employee, bought a lily bouquet for Tk 550 for his newly married wife and said he was satisfied with the purchase.\n\nOutside the capital, traders reported a similar trend.\n\nIn Rajshahi’s Saheb Bazar area, Monirul Islam said business was significantly lower than last year.\n\n‘We had high hopes centring on Valentine’s Day and the parliamentary elections. Usually, this day ensures brisk sales from morning till late at night. But this year, customer turnout is much lower,’ he said.\n\nHe added that traders had stocked large quantities of roses, gerberas and gladiolus, anticipating strong demand.\n\n‘We increased supply considering both the elections and Valentine’s Day atmosphere. But sales did not match expectations,’ he said.\n\nAbdul Majid, another trader at the city’s Railgate area, said the electoral process prompted many students to leave for their hometowns to vote.\n\n‘Rajshahi is largely a city of students. A significant portion of our customers are university and college students. As many of them left the city ahead of the polls, the usual Valentine’s crowd is missing,’ he said.\n\nIn Chattogram, the situation appeared even starker.\n\nUjjal Das, manager of Shorup Flower Shop, said sales had dropped dramatically compared to previous years.\n\n‘Last year, total sales in the market were around Tk 50 to 60 lakhs. This year, the flower market in Chattogram will not even reach close to Tk 10 lakhs,’ he said.\n\nHe attributed the decline to limited public outings and the absence of large celebrations due to the election.\n\n‘People did not come out much, and there were no grand celebrations. We also did not receive bulk orders. If supporters buy flowers to welcome the newly elected MPs, perhaps business may regain some momentum,’ he added.",

    "body": "This photograph shows the logo for “Ubisoft”, displayed at the “Paris Games Week” fair in Paris on November 1, 2023. | AFP photo\n\nTroubled French games giant Ubisoft will strive to project confidence this weekend with a massive esports event for its shooter ‘Rainbow Six Siege’, while hoping a reorganisation and expansion to China can keep the money rolling in.\n\n‘We’re stepping things up a lot for 2026 with China coming aboard,’ said Francois-Xavier Deniele, head of marketing and esports for the franchise.\n\n‘The balance is going to change, we know that when they arrive in a game, they’re extremely competitive’.\n\nChinese internet giant TenCent has climbed aboard as an investor in ‘Rainbow Six’ and Ubisoft’s other top-selling titles ‘Assassin’s Creed’ and ‘Far Cry’.\n\nThe mega-franchises are stabled together in one of a string of new ‘creative houses’, supposed to offer the group’s development teams more financial and creative freedom after several years of financial woes, job cuts and a tumbling share price.\n\nChina is ‘a very, very mature market, a lot more mature even than (the West) for this kind of game,’ Deniele said.\n\nBut TenCent’s billion-euro investment in exchange for a 26-per cent stake in Vantage, finalised last November, suggests it believes in Ubisoft titles’ ability to hold their own.\n\nWith a $3-million prize pool, this weekend’s Ubisoft-organised invitational event in Paris for top teams is ‘a heck of a signal’ that ‘shows we’re capable of packing the Adidas Arena,’ Deniele said.\n\nThe Paris venue’s 8,000 seats are more often filled by basketball or music fans.\n\nIn China, ‘it’s totally natural for the new generation to watch esports matches and play with their friends in PC bangs (cybercafes)... very similar to Korea,’ Deniele said.\n\nThis year’s busy esports season for ‘Siege’ follows on from last year’s revamp of its systems and graphics, which ‘laid the foundations for the 10 years ahead,’ he added.\n\nA team first-person shooter in the vein of genre classics like ‘Counter-Strike’, ‘Rainbow Six Siege’ is one of Ubisoft’s biggest titles, rewarding coordinated tactical play and deft use of destructible environments.\n\n‘Siege’ has not escaped wobbles of its own in recent months.\n\nHackers gained access in December to systems that allowed them to ban or restore large numbers of accounts and manipulate the game’s cosmetic item marketplace -- a key source of revenue.\n\nIn such cases ‘the community needs to be reassured very quickly’, Deniele said, crediting the ‘ultra-fast’ reaction of the development team for the fact that ‘people came back to the game and were happy with what we were able to do’.\n\nDevelopers must also ensure a steady pipeline of fresh content for today’s long-lived online games, with ‘Rainbow Six’ facing competition from incumbents such as ‘Call of Duty’, ‘Valorant’ or ‘Overwatch’.\n\nNew challengers are also constantly emerging onto the unforgiving field.\n\nWildlight Entertainment, developers of fantasy shooter title ‘Highguard’, which launched in January to great fanfare, on Wednesday announced layoffs from its small development team -- leaving only a ‘core group’ to maintain the game.\n\nAt this weekend’s ‘Rainbow Six’ event ‘we’ll be announcing a quicker release schedule for content, because people want more and more’, Deniele said.\n\n‘It’s a game people play every day, so we have to get faster.’",

    "body": "| — New Age\n\nSUNDERBAN Day is observed every February 14 to celebrate and create awareness of the Sunderbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. Situated in the delta of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna rivers along the coasts of Bangladesh and India, the Sunderbans represents an extraordinary interface between land and sea. This vast mangrove wetland and forest swamp ecosystem is globally known for its biodiversity, ecological services and cultural importance. Yet, as 14 February returns each year, the observance is not only a celebration but also a solemn reminder of the mounting climatic and environmental pressures reshaping this fragile ecosystem.\n\nThe Sunderbans functions through a complex interplay of physical, biogeochemical and biological processes. Climatic factors such as sea-level rise, rainfall variability, temperature anomalies, tidal fluctuations, glacier melting and cyclonic disturbances regulate these processes. Their influences extend beyond the forest, ultimately affecting fisheries, agriculture, freshwater availability, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and human health. Understanding these interconnected relationships is essential for appreciating both the resilience and vulnerability of this remarkable mangrove system.\n\nTides form the rhythmic pulse of the Sunderbans. The mangroves are characterised by semi-diurnal tidal cycles, with a notable asymmetry between ebb and flood tides. The ebb tide is typically shorter in duration but stronger in current velocity than the flood tide. When high tide reaches the head of a creek, it often begins to recede at the mouth, creating a water slope that accelerates the return flow. This strong ebb current helps to maintain tidal channels by preventing excessive sediment accumulation. However, in downstream coastal areas with shallow inter-tidal mudflats, frictional effects dominate, limiting the formation of strong tidal jets. During ebb tide, nutrient-rich water from the mangrove wetlands enters nearshore regions at low velocity and mixes slowly with offshore waters. Flood tides, influenced by strong waves, often push coastal water back into mangrove creeks, facilitating exchange between marine and estuarine systems.\n\nThe initial inundation of mangrove swamps during rising tides is unique. Water infiltrates the soil through numerous crab burrows, creating micro-scale mixing that acts as a buffer against salt accumulation and enhances nutrient exchange. The balance between rainfall and evaporation, combined with tidal amplitude, plays a decisive role in determining vegetation productivity and zonation within the swamp forests. Nutrient availability, essential for primary production, fluctuates with tidal variation and can differ between neap and spring tides. The export of leaf litter from mangrove ecosystems is also strongly influenced by tidal amplitude. Higher tidal ranges carry a substantial proportion of litter into adjacent waters, supporting detrital food webs, while lower amplitudes limit this export. Increased tidal fluctuation accelerates microbial decomposition of detritus and influences microbial population dynamics, shaping nutrient cycling and energy flow.\n\nSea-level rise poses one of the most profound long-term threats to the Sunderbans. Mangroves thrive in low-lying coastal zones, making them highly sensitive to even small increases in sea surface height. In the Sunderban region, the rate of sea-level rise has exceeded the global average in recent decades. Given the region’s extremely low elevation, typically less than two metres above the mean sea level, the consequences are magnified. Coastal erosion has intensified, particularly along southern sea-facing islands, leading to significant land loss over the past half century. Some islands have already submerged, and others remain under serious threat.\n\nIf the rate of landward migration of mangroves is slower than the rate of habitat loss due to rising seas, degradation becomes inevitable. Sea-level rise also accelerates salinity intrusion into freshwater zones, reshaping species composition. Low-salinity tolerant species decline, while salt-tolerant species expand inland. Such shifts alter forest structure, reduce biodiversity and affect ecosystem carbon stocks. In addition, erosion and altered sediment deposition patterns modify tidal creeks and create new marshy areas in upstream zones. These geomorphic transformations illustrate how physical climate drivers cascade into ecological change.\n\nTemperature rise further compounds these pressures. Sea surface temperatures in the Bengal delta have increased at rates higher than those observed in many other tropical oceans. Warmer temperatures influence the phenology, growth and distribution of species. In the Sunderbans, temperature variations affect mangrove growth patterns, phytoplankton diversity and fish populations. Higher summer temperatures are associated with greater phytoplankton diversity while winter months often show reduced abundance. Fish species respond to temperature shifts through altered growth rates, reproductive cycles and migration patterns. At the microbial level, elevated temperatures stimulate bacterial activity, influencing nutrient transformations and organic matter decomposition. However, extreme heat events may exceed physiological tolerance limits, leading to stress and mortality in sensitive organisms.\n\nSalinity intrusion remains one of the defining stressors in the Sunderbans. Seasonal variation is pronounced, with peak salinity occurring during the dry pre-monsoon months and declining sharply after the onset of monsoon rains. Reduced freshwater flow from upstream rivers, partly because of infrastructural developments such as dams and expanded shrimp aquaculture, has intensified salinity levels. Subsurface soil salinity has increased significantly over recent decades, extending beyond the core mangrove zones. Elevated salinity stunts mangrove growth, reduces canopy density and contributes to diseases such as the ‘top dying’ condition affecting economically valuable tree species such as Heritiera fomes. Salinity gradients also influence carbon storage, with low-salinity zones generally supporting higher carbon stocks. The deterioration of water quality due to combined salinity intrusion and anthropogenic pollutants has adversely affected fish larvae and commercially important species, contributing to declines in fisheries productivity.\n\nGlacier melting in the Himalayas introduces another layer of climatic complexity. These glaciers feed the river systems that sustain the Sunderbans. In the short term, accelerated glacier melt may increase river discharge during dry seasons, but long-term projections suggest eventual reductions in flow. Enhanced meltwater contributes to increased sediment loads, altering channel morphology and inundation patterns within the delta. Heavy sediment deposition may modify salinity regimes and influence species succession in mangrove swamps. Rainfall variability also plays a crucial role. The majority of annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season, delivering nutrients and sediments to the wetlands. However, excessive runoff increases turbidity, reducing light penetration and inhibiting phytoplankton photosynthesis. Conversely, drought conditions may elevate tree mortality and reduce carbon sequestration. Seasonal nutrient dynamics fluctuate with rainfall intensity, affecting primary production and ecosystem functioning.\n\nCyclones and tidal surges represent acute climatic disturbances with both destructive and protective dimensions. The frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal have increased over time, and projections indicate further escalation. Mangroves serve as natural barriers, reducing wind speed and absorbing storm surge energy. During major cyclonic events, the Sunderbans has shielded inland populations from catastrophic damage. However, repeated severe storms damage forest structure, uproot trees and reduce regeneration capacity. The cumulative impact of successive cyclones raises concerns about long-term resilience.\n\nClimatic variability linked to El Niño Southern Oscillation further influences rainfall, temperature and river discharge patterns. ENSO events can intensify monsoon anomalies, alter sediment transport and modify tidal regimes. Elevated temperatures during strong ENSO phases may disrupt aquatic population structures, reduce fish stocks and alter nutrient cycling. Flooding associated with ENSO can favour low-salinity species while stressing salt-adapted organisms, contributing to shifts in community composition.\n\nSeasonal dynamics in physicochemical conditions shape the Sunderbans’ ecological rhythms. Turbidity typically peaks during monsoon months, while salinity and dissolved oxygen may be higher in pre-monsoon periods. Nutrient concentrations fluctuate widely across seasons, sometimes leading to phosphorus or nitrogen limitation. Total organic carbon levels vary accordingly, influencing microbial processes and food-web interactions. These seasonal oscillations underscore the sensitivity of the ecosystem to climatic variability.\n\nHabitat modification has become increasingly evident. Although overall forest extent may appear relatively stable in some assessments, forest health has declined in many areas. Tree density and biomass have decreased, and shoreline erosion has led to island submergence. Creek closure due to sediment deposition alters hydrological connectivity, affecting nutrient exchange and species distribution. Rising salinity and reduced freshwater input have transformed vegetation patterns and exacerbated disease prevalence. Primary production in the Sunderbans displays marked spatio-temporal variation. Litterfall rates differ among mangrove species and fluctuate seasonally. Decomposition accelerates during warm and humid monsoon months. Phytoplankton blooms often peak in post-monsoon periods, supporting higher trophic levels. However, climate-induced alterations in temperature, nutrient supply and turbidity can disrupt these cycles. Changes in phytoplankton composition reverberate through zooplankton communities and ultimately influence fish abundance and diversity.\n\nEutrophication poses additional risks. Elevated nutrient concentrations may stimulate excessive phytoplankton growth, particularly of cyanobacteria, which thrive under warmer conditions. Such blooms reduce food quality for zooplankton and fish and may lead to oxygen depletion when large populations decay. Nutrient enrichment can also destabilise mangrove forests by promoting disproportionate shoot growth relative to root systems, increasing vulnerability to water stress. The impacts of climatic change extend to human health. Altered hydrological patterns and salinity intrusion can enhance the survival of waterborne pathogens such as Vibrio species. Post-cyclone outbreaks of cholera, gastroenteritis and diarrhoeal diseases have been documented among communities near the mangroves. As climate change intensifies, public health vulnerabilities may increase in low-lying coastal areas dependent on fragile water resources.\n\nAs Sunderban Day is observed each year, the significance of these intertwined climatic and ecological transformations becomes ever clearer. The Sunderbans stands as both a symbol of resilience and a warning of vulnerability. Its mangrove forests protect coastlines, store carbon, sustain fisheries and support millions of livelihoods. Yet, the combined pressures of sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, glacier melt, temperature increase, cyclones, ENSO variability and habitat modification threaten to alter its ecological identity. Sunderban Day must, therefore, serve not merely as an occasion of commemoration but as a renewed call for coordinated action. Strengthened transboundary cooperation, adaptive management strategies, pollution control, sustainable freshwater allocation and climate-resilient livelihoods are essential. Protecting and restoring mangrove habitats through nature-based solutions can enhance resilience against rising seas and intensifying storms. Sunderban Day reminds us that safeguarding this extraordinary mangrove ecosystem is both a regional responsibility and a global imperative. The future of the Bengal delta’s biodiversity, coastal stability and human well-being depends on collective efforts to understand, respect and protect the living dynamics of the Sunderbans.\n\nArghya Protik Chowdhury ([email protected]) is a student of environmental science in the Bangladesh University of Professionals.",

    "title": "Unless taxpayers and tax collectors work together to achieve the goal of...",
    "body": "Tax terrorism\n\nUnless taxpayers and tax collectors work together to achieve the goal of revenue for the development, tax terrorism will continue to thrive, writes Ahmed Munirus Saleheen\n\nTHIS is for perhaps for the first time we have heard a new expression with regard to taxation in Bangladesh: tax terrorism. Recently, in an investment dialogue organised by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, a prominent business leader raised his voice against ‘tax terrorism.’\n\nAlthough various elements of tax terrorism encourage corruption in the tax system, tax corruption and ‘tax terrorism’ are not synonymous. ‘Tax terrorism’ is a bureaucratic process within a legal framework, which is characterised by the abuse of power, especially excessive discretionary power of tax officials, policy unpredictability, discriminatory application of law, and overly aggressive enforcement of the rules. In this, there is a shift from a supportive regulatory environment to one characterised by fear and coercion.\n\nWhile it is generally detested by taxpayers, for the tax authorities, it may mean a tool for better tax compliance and, hence more revenue. ‘Tax terrorism’ thus may be seen as a ‘reaction’ rather than an ‘action’. For, the tax authorities appear to use the process in response to problems such as reluctance to comply with tax obligations, tax evasion and tax avoidance. In Bangladesh, one trigger for ‘tax terrorism’ is the pressure to achieve higher tax revenue targets compared to the existing revenue potential and capacity.\n\nIt is a big paradox in the tax system of Bangladesh that on one side there are allegations of tax terrorism and on the other side there is a pathetic picture of tax-GDP ratio. According to the chairman of the National Board of Revenue, the tax-GDP ratio has decreased from 7.4 per cent in the previous year to 6.6 per cent this year. Narrow tax base compared to GDP, unsatisfactory tax compliance situation, tax evasion, widespread tax exemption, weakness of tax-revenue management and corruption, etc are broadly identified as the reasons for the low tax-GDP ratio.\n\nPersons with the knowledge of Bangladesh taxation system would admit that the elements of ‘tax terrorism’ are strongly present in the tax system of Bangladesh. One example of policy driven-discrimination is the provision for whitening black money in the Income Tax Act. This scheme allows an individual to legalise undeclared assets by paying a nominal 15 per cent tax, while honest taxpayers have to face a rate of up to 30 per cent. Many, including the World Bank and Transparency International Bangladesh, have called it a corruption-enhancing and discriminatory provision. Another such provision is the Minimum Tax Provision for Companies. On August 26, 2025, at a roundtable discussion at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, keynote speaker Tamim Ahmed commented that while the provision of minimum tax for companies, regardless of profit or loss, ensures their contribution to government revenue, it hinders the objective of fairness in the tax system. At the same event, the NBR chairman himself admitted, ‘Undoubtedly, this is a black law’. He also frankly admitted that repealing such ‘black laws’ would further reduce the country’s tax revenue collection.\n\nThe excessive discretionary power of the tax authorities in Bangladesh is another worrisome issue which also paves the way for tax terrorism. Determining the notional tariff value of imported goods instead of the actual transaction value in the Customs law and imposing presumptive VAT of VAT-paying businesses in the VAT law are just a couple of examples of discretionary power vested on the NBR or individual officers of Customs and VAT. Here too, in defence of the discretionary powers, it is widely argued that many importers resort to under-invoicing and VAT registered traders do not report their actual sales.\n\nWhether an ‘action’ or a ‘reaction’, tax-terrorism activities at the end of the day often create discriminatory sufferings for honest taxpayers, create unhealthy competition in business and discourage investment, thus making it an unwanted burden on the country’s business and economy.\n\nThe government must take the first initiative to reduce tax terrorism. In this case, the tax administration must come out of the one-sided focus of achieving revenue targets by coercibly enforcing the law without paying little or no heed to the basic principles of taxation — certainty, transparency and fairness. We must not forget that tax compliance — obligatory or voluntary — presupposes trust and respect. And, to gain the trust and respect of the taxpayer, the accountability of the tax administration must be ensured in the first place.\n\nHowever, imposing the responsibility for the alleged tax terror solely on the government is tantamount to presenting a matter in a fragmented manner without understanding the entirety of the issue. In this case, the taxpayers and the business community also have a lot of responsibilities at the backdrop of the context, mentioned earlier, in which tax terrorism flourishes. Given the urgency of maximising revenue in a poor-tax GDP ratio scenario, taxpayers in general and business community in particular must cooperate with tax authorities, especially in the areas of tax compliance, fair implementation of tax laws and rules, tax base expansion and the prevention of tax evasion. Sccording to CPD estimates, the amount of tax evaded in 2023 is two and a half lakh crore takas. Instead of keeping themselves preoccupied only with their demands for reduced tax or easier compliance mechanism, they also must come up with clear and unambiguous proposals on what to do in the government’s policies and policy implementation to raise the country’s tax-GDP ratio to the desired level.\n\nUnless both taxpayers and tax-collectors work together to achieve this essential goal of ‘revenue for the development of the country’, tax terrorism will continue to thrive and we will continue to revolve in the circle of blame-game. A win-win approach is essential for curbing tax terrorism. And suppressing ‘tax terrorism’ is necessary not only to alleviate business hardship, but also to build a fair, transparent and self-reliant economy.\n\nDr Ahmed Munirus Saleheen, a former senior secretary, is a tax researcher.",

    "body": "In need of strict law and order to prevent post-polls violence\n\nPOST-ELECTION violence and destruction, on a small scale compared with the past though, are no less alarming. They are another reminder of how fragile democratic moments remain. At least two people have already been dead and more than 30 people are injured in post-election violence. A young man was killed in a clash between rival factions of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in Munshiganj on February 13. The deceased was a supporter of an independent, an expelled BNP district member secretary. In a similar incident at Kachua in Bagerhat, a supporter of a ‘rebel’ Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidate was killed. He died from his injuries on February 14 while being treated in Khulna Medical College Hospital. It is commendable that the BNP leader elected for the Chandpur 3 constituency has taken legal action and handed over five young members of his party for their alleged involvement in post-election violence. The party, which will soon form the government after a landslide victory and has repeatedly pledged commitment to a peaceful and democratic future, has, however, greater responsibility and should democratically resolve grievances within the party. Its regard for democratic governance, otherwise, would prove rhetorical.\n\nThere are also reported incidents of violence between supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islam. In Patuakhali, at least five people were injured in violence between BNP and Jamaat activists. In the Pabna 1 constituency, the BNP candidate who lost alleged that around a dozen of his supporters had been attacked in at least three localities by supporters of the Jamaat candidate who won. Six people were injured as Jamaat and BNP supporters clashed over election results in Chuadanga. There are also allegations against the activists of Jamaat that they spread rumours on social media about the election. The incidents contradict the party’s claims as it prepares to be sworn in as the opposition in the parliament. In a statement, the party chief said that they would act as a principled and peaceful opposition while contributing constructively to national progress. The role of an opposition is as important as the ruling party’s and the Jamaat-e-Islami should prove its regard for the rule of law. All other political parties, regardless of the election results, should act responsibly at this critical moment of political transition. The National Citizen Party has voiced serious concerns about its safety, citing threats from unidentified groups, an alarming development that law enforcement agencies should address without delay.\n\nThe interim government must recognise that law and order are equally crucial in the post-election period and its responsibility does not end with the announcement of the results. While it must ensure a peaceful transfer of power and uphold law and order to that end, the political parties, especially the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami should show restraints.",

    "body": "Reworking universities\n\nThe proposed transformation of the University Grants Commission into a higher education commission offers an opportunity to move beyond data aggregation for ranking submissions, writes Fahad Hussain\n\nFOR decades, the prestige of higher education in Bangladesh rested largely on historical reputation and anecdotal pride. That era is now giving way to something quieter but more consequential. Across campuses, a shift is underway — from rhetorical claims of excellence to deliberate, measurable strategies aimed at institutional positioning. University rankings, once peripheral, have become central markers of success, prominently displayed on websites, letterheads and public communications. What may appear superficial at first glance reflects a deeper transformation in how universities understand competition, accountability and survival.\n\nAmong public universities, this competition is largely unspoken but unmistakable. Vice-chancellors increasingly cite ranking progress in conversations with peers, donors and policymakers, sometimes even using these achievements to justify demands for greater funding. More importantly, rankings are beginning to shape internal governance. Universities are drafting campus-wide action plans, revising faculty promotion criteria and encouraging academics to pursue externally funded research. Participation in national and international academic platforms is also rising — not only for ranking points, but for visibility, policy engagement and social relevance. While restrained, this contest marks a departure from long-standing institutional complacency.\n\nThe University of Dhaka’s recent placement — 52nd globally and first in South Asia in the Times Higher Education Interdisciplinary Science Rankings 2026 — illustrates what focused intervention can achieve within a short timeframe. Equally significant is the performance of younger public universities, some of which are now outperforming older institutions long assumed to be unassailable. These developments are quietly dismantling hierarchies rooted more in legacy than performance, signalling a healthier, more merit-based academic ecosystem.\n\nThe private university sector, however, reveals sharper contrasts. A small group of established institutions has already aligned itself with global benchmarks, often outperforming better-funded public universities in research impact and international outlook. These universities have invested heavily in permanent faculty with strong publication records, sometimes at costs far exceeding public-sector norms. For many others, the current emphasis on rankings has exposed structural weaknesses long ignored.\n\nHistorically, a reliance on young lecturers and part-time faculty allowed private universities to expand rapidly while keeping costs low. While visiting academics contribute professional expertise, they are rarely positioned to build sustained research agendas or mentor future scholars. This model is now colliding with reality. Entry into the Times Higher Education World University Rankings requires at least 1,000 Scopus-indexed publications over five years — a threshold that many private universities, even after decades of operation, struggle to approach. As students increasingly scrutinise such data before enrolling, institutions are discovering that reputational survival depends on long-term investment in permanent academic staff and research infrastructure.\n\nPerhaps, the most meaningful change is occurring within internal policy frameworks. University autonomy, once a justification for stagnation, is being reassessed. Though uneven and limited to a handful of institutions, public universities have begun introducing tangible incentives for research productivity. These include reimbursement of article processing charges, modest financial rewards for high-impact publications and expanded doctoral programmes with monthly stipends and annual research grants. Such measures, while still fragile, represent a decisive break from the past.\n\nThe research ecosystem is also being reshaped by improved digital infrastructure. Remote access to academic databases, institutional repositories and an emerging emphasis on patenting and commercialisation are broadening how scholarship is valued. Faculty members who once published almost exclusively in local, non-indexed journals are increasingly engaging with international platforms — not merely for rankings, but for professional relevance in a global academic economy.\n\nThis momentum, however, requires strategic direction. The proposed transformation of the University Grants Commission into a Higher Education Commission offers an opportunity to move beyond data aggregation for ranking submissions. What is needed instead are standardised national guidelines that ensure research incentives, quality assurance and governance reforms are applied consistently across institutions. Rankings should function as tools, not targets — means to improve teaching quality, research ethics and graduate employability rather than ends in themselves.\n\nThe urgency of this shift is underscored by global projections. According to Towards 2035: Projecting the Future of Global Higher Education, South Asia is expected to become the world’s largest academic region by enrolment, with Bangladesh projected as the seventh-largest contributor to new students globally. At the same time, the global higher education sector is forecast to generate a non-research market worth over $1 trillion. Without corresponding improvements in quality, governance and international credibility, Bangladesh risks becoming a volume producer of degrees with limited global value.\n\nThe ranking race is not without valid criticism. Metrics can distort priorities and reduce education to numerical performance. Yet, if this competition compels universities to fund research, support permanent faculty and rethink stagnant governance structures, it may serve a corrective purpose. Bangladesh is edging away from the margins of the global academic map. Whether it moves closer to the centre will depend on whether this moment is treated as a cosmetic exercise — or as the beginning of genuine structural reform.\n\nDr Fahad Hussain is an associate professor of pharmacy and additional director of the ranking and strategic development cell at Noakhali Science and Technology University.",

    "body": "Religion-based politics and periphery\n\nFront pages of newspapers feature the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s win in the February 12 national elections. | Agence France-Presse/Mohd Rasfan\n\nPRELIMINARY constituency-level patterns emerging from Bangladesh’s 2026 parliamentary election suggest that Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami achieved its strongest performances in districts such as Rangpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Rajshashi, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Jhenaidah, Jessore, Kushtia, Meherpur, Chuadanga, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Khulna, Cumilla, and pockets of Dhaka. The socio-economic character of these constituencies aligns closely with the party’s historical electoral terrain: agrarian neighbourhoods, semi-urban district towns, and lower-middle-income peri-urban belts. Understanding this geography is crucial not only for interpreting Jamaat’s electoral gains but also for illuminating broader structural patterns in Bangladesh’s uneven development.\n\nElectoral sociology repeatedly shows that political parties do not mobilise support randomly; they root themselves in particular social strata and economic formations. Jamaat’s 2026 constituency profile suggests continuity rather than rupture. Its vote clusters in areas that lie outside Bangladesh’s main industrial growth corridors and where economic modernisation has been partial, uneven, or delayed. These regions represent what may be called ‘peripheral Bangladesh’: socially organised around traditional institutions, economically dependent on agriculture and small commerce, and politically distant from the state-centred patronage networks concentrated in metropolitan zones.\n\nAgrarian and small-town economies\n\nTHE first defining feature of Jamaat-leaning constituencies is their agrarian-small-town economic base. District belts in Satkhira, Bagerhat, Meherpur, Chuadanga, Kushtia, Jhenaidah, Rangpur, Kurigram, and Gaibandha are characterised by rice cultivation, jute farming, fisheries, and local trading rather than export-orientated manufacturing. Employment diversification remains limited, with few large factories or industrial estates comparable to those in Gazipur or Narayanganj. Households rely on small landholdings, seasonal agricultural labour, petty trade, and modest remittance flows from migrant workers in the Gulf or Southeast Asia.\n\nIn development terms, these are economies undergoing incomplete structural transformation. Agriculture continues to dominate livelihoods even as younger generations seek non-farm employment that remains scarce locally. Such conditions produce a distinctive electorate composed less of industrial wage labourers or professional middle classes and more of small farmers, shopkeepers, madrassah-educated youth, and informal entrepreneurs. Political behaviour in such contexts tends to be shaped by community-level networks and moral legitimacy rather than class-based labour politics or technocratic development narratives.\n\nComparative political sociology has long observed that Islamist parties gain traction in settings where market modernisation and secular political mobilisation have penetrated unevenly. Bangladesh’s agrarian small-town belts fit this pattern. Economic aspiration exists, but pathways to upward mobility remain uncertain. In this environment, religiously framed promises of justice, integrity, and social order often resonate more deeply than programmatic economic agendas.\n\nMadrassah density and civil society\n\nA SECOND structural feature of Jamaat-strong constituencies is the density of religious institutions. Districts such as Satkhira, Bagerhat, Gaibandha, Kurigram and Jhenaidah possess long traditions of Islamic scholarship and high concentrations of madrassahs, mosques, and faith-based welfare organisations. These institutions perform roles extending beyond education: they provide charity, dispute mediation, social solidarity, and moral authority in communities where state services are limited or inconsistently delivered.\n\nPolitical mobilisation in such contexts often follows institutional pathways. Jamaat historically developed a cadre-based organisational model rooted in mosque committees, madrassah networks, and Islamic student organisations. Where these institutions are socially embedded, the party’s organisational continuity gives it advantages over personality-centred mainstream parties that depend more heavily on patronage or charismatic leadership. Religion-based legitimacy becomes a form of political capital, particularly in districts where voters evaluate candidates not only by material promises but also by perceived piety and moral credibility.\n\nImportantly, the prominence of institutions of religious affairs in these constituencies does not simply indicate ideological conservatism. Rather, it reflects institutional substitution. In regions where public education quality is uneven, health services are distant, and welfare delivery is fragmented, religion-based networks often fill governance gaps. Political actors aligned with these networks benefit from established trust and social reach. Jamaat’s electoral presence thus mirrors the geography of religiously-minded civil society rather than merely doctrinal preference.\n\nLower middle-class moral economy\n\nTHE socio-economic base of Jamaat support in Bangladesh has often been described as the lower-middle class or the “respectable poor.” Constituency profiles from the 2026 election reinforce this characterisation. Voters in these districts frequently include small landowners, school or madrassah teachers, shopkeepers, overseas migrant families, and educated yet underemployed youth. Their economic position is neither destitute nor secure; livelihoods are modest but socially respectable, and education levels exceed income opportunities.\n\nSuch groups often experience what sociologists term status anxiety. Educational attainment raises expectations for mobility that local economies cannot fulfil. Corruption in recruitment, politicised access to state benefits, and patronage-driven governance deepen frustration. In this social milieu, political appeals framed around moral governance, accountability, and ethical leadership gain traction. Islamist discourse often articulates these aspirations through the language of religion that emphasises justice, honesty, and social responsibility.\n\nThe resonance of Jamaat’s message among these strata does not necessarily stem from doctrinal radicalism. Rather, it reflects a search for order and fairness in contexts perceived as morally disordered. Where secular parties are viewed as factional or corrupt, religiously anchored parties may appear comparatively principled. Thus, Jamaat’s electoral gains can be interpreted as expressions of lower-middle-class discontent and moral aspiration within structurally constrained economies.\n\nPeripheral inclusion in development gains\n\nBANGLADESH’S economic transformation over the past three decades has been spatially uneven. Growth has concentrated along the Dhaka–Chattogram industrial corridor and in urban manufacturing zones. Many Jamaat-leaning constituencies lie outside these high-growth belts. District economies in Rangpur, Kurigram, Kushtia, Satkhira, and rural Cumilla depend heavily on agriculture, remittance inflows, and small trade, with limited industrial investment and weaker infrastructure connectivity.\n\nSuch regions often perceive themselves as peripheral to national development narratives. Large infrastructure projects, export industries, and urban employment opportunities appear distant both geographically and socially. Climate vulnerabilities such as river erosion or seasonal flooding further constrain local economies. Political scientists note that opposition or ideologically distinct parties frequently gain ground in peripheral districts where ruling-party patronage networks are thinner and development benefits less visible.\n\nJamaat’s 2026 electoral geography fits this pattern. Its stronger performances in economically modest districts suggest mobilisation among populations who feel marginal to rapid national growth. Electoral support thus reflects not only ideological affinity but also territorial inequality. The party becomes a vehicle through which peripheral regions articulate political presence within a centralised development state.\n\nUrban-fringe middle classes in Dhaka\n\nREPORTS that Jamaat candidates competed strongly in several Dhaka constituencies indicate a second socio-economic cluster: urban-fringe lower-middle-income neighbourhoods shaped by migration and informal urbanisation. These areas house large numbers of migrants from rural districts who engage in informal labour, small services, transport work, and petty commerce. Housing is dense, incomes unstable, and social mobility uncertain, while community life often retains rural cultural patterns, including mosque-centred networks and madrassah education for children.\n\nRecent electoral accounts further suggest that Jamaat strategically concentrated supporters from multiple districts into selected Dhaka constituencies during the 2026 election period. Such relocation — whether temporary or longer-term — reflects the party’s capacity to mobilise disciplined organisational networks across rural-urban migration chains. By aggregating sympathetic voters within competitive urban seats, Jamaat appears to have amplified its electoral weight in specific constituencies rather than dispersing support across the metropolitan region. This strategy aligns with patterns observed in cadre-based parties that leverage associational density and residential clustering to overcome demographic disadvantage in large cities.\n\nThis peri-urban population therefore embodies a hybrid social condition: urban precarity combined with rural moral economy, now reinforced by politically organised migration linkages. Residents participate in city labour markets while maintaining village-based social identities, kinship ties, and institutions of religion. In such settings, the interplay of economic insecurity, communal solidarity, and networked political mobilisation can facilitate Islamist electoral consolidation, particularly where mainstream urban politics is perceived as elite-dominated or inaccessible.\n\nJamaat’s strengthened presence in Dhaka’s lower-income pockets thus reflects both the urbanisation of its traditional agrarian-small-town base and the strategic spatial concentration of supporters within winnable constituencies. It signals not penetration into affluent metropolitan society but the political activation of Dhaka’s migrant periphery — an urban extension of peripheral Bangladesh rather than the mainstreaming of Islamist politics among established urban middle classes.\n\nPolitical realignment after regime change\n\nTHE 2026 election followed a period of national political restructuring after the 2024 regime transition. Jamaat’s improved electoral position, emerging as a major opposition force behind the BNP, partly reflects broader realignment: legal re-legitimation, alliance shifts, and participation in protest movements. However, socio-economic mapping suggests that its actual constituency victories still cluster in long-standing strongholds rather than newly affluent zones.\n\nThis distinction is significant. Electoral resurgence could be interpreted superficially as ideological expansion. Yet constituency-level socio-economics indicate continuity in the party’s social base. Jamaat’s gains represent renewed mobilisation of historically sympathetic regions rather than transformation into a cross-class or metropolitan party. Political opportunity structures changed nationally, but the party’s embedded support remained geographically and socially consistent.\n\nInterpreting the socio-economic pattern\n\nTAKEN together, the constituencies where Jamaat performed strongly in 2026 represent a recognisable socio-economic formation: economically modest, socially conservative, institutionally religious, and developmentally peripheral Bangladesh. These districts share moderate state presence, strong religiously-minded civil society, constrained mobility pathways, and communities shaped by smallholder agriculture and informal commerce. Political appeals centred on moral governance and social justice framed through idioms from religion find receptive audiences here.\n\nThis pattern aligns with broader South Asian and Muslim-majority democratic contexts, where Islamist parties often draw support from lower-middle classes in semi-urban and agrarian regions experiencing uneven modernisation. Economic aspiration without structural transformation creates conditions in which moral-order politics resonates. Bangladesh’s electoral map in 2026 appears to reproduce this comparative pattern rather than diverge from it.\n\nDevelopment inequality and political representation\n\nTHE socio-economic profile of Jamaat-leaning constituencies also invites reflection on Bangladesh’s development trajectory. Rapid growth has lifted national income and reduced poverty, yet spatial and sectoral disparities persist. Peripheral districts with limited industrialisation and infrastructure may feel excluded from narratives of prosperity. Political representation becomes a channel through which such regions assert visibility and claim inclusion.\n\nJamaat’s electoral footholds therefore illuminate territorial inequality as much as ideological preference. Voters in agrarian small-town districts may support parties that articulate grievances against centralised patronage or perceived neglect. Religion-based networks amplify these grievances through moral discourse. The resulting political geography reveals the intersection of uneven development and identity-based mobilisation.\n\nMoral politics in constrained economies\n\nANOTHER lens for interpreting Jamaat’s 2026 gains is the sociology of moral politics. In communities where economic resources are scarce and state institutions distrusted, moral legitimacy becomes a crucial basis of authority. Religion-based leaders, teachers, and socially respected figures command influence that may translate into political mobilisation. Jamaat’s historical emphasis on discipline, social service, and ethical conduct resonates in such settings.\n\nThe lower-middle-class voters prominent in these constituencies often seek stability and dignity more than radical transformation. They value order, fairness, and recognition of social respectability. Islamist politics framed around justice and community welfare speaks directly to these aspirations. Electoral support thus reflects moral economy as much as ideological alignment.\n\nContinuity rather than rupture\n\nTHE geography of Jamaat-e-Islami’s 2026 parliamentary gains suggests continuity in Bangladesh’s political sociology. Its electoral base remains rooted in agrarian-small-town lower-middle classes and religiously-minded networked communities rather than industrial or metropolitan growth zones. These constituencies sit at the margins of rapid economic transformation, where aspirations for social justice, moral governance, and community-centred welfare intersect with structural constraints.\n\nThe party’s performance therefore appears less a sudden ideological shift than the political articulation of enduring socio-economic structures in peripheral districts. Electoral change followed national political realignment, yet social foundations remained stable. Understanding this continuity is essential for interpreting Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape.\n\nConcluding reflections\n\nBANGLADESH’S 2026 election map underscores a central lesson of political sociology: electoral outcomes are inseparable from socio-economic geography. The districts where Jamaat-e-Islami gained seats embody a particular configuration of development, class, and institutional life. They represent Bangladesh beyond its export-industrial narrative — regions where agriculture, small commerce, and religious civil society shape everyday existence and political perception.\n\nAs the country continues its transformation, the persistence of such constituencies reminds policymakers that growth has not been evenly territorial or socially inclusive. Political pluralism will continue to reflect these disparities. Jamaat’s electoral presence, whatever one’s normative evaluation, signals the enduring political voice of Bangladesh’s peripheral lower-middle classes and religiously-minded organised communities. Understanding that voice requires attention not only to ideology but also to the socio-economic landscapes in which it is rooted.\n\nMusharraf Tansen, a former country representative of the Malala Fund, is a development analyst.",

Our bowling attack was good; they bowled well. Actually the match got close because of some misfieldings,’ she added.\n\nSanjida, on the other hand, was happy to contribute.\n\n‘Alhamdulillah, it feels good, as I managed to contribute and we did well as a team. As we have managed to win the first game, hopefully we can get a good result in the tournament, inshaallah,’ said the 24-year-old spinner.\n\nBangladesh will face Thailand on February 16 before taking on Malaysia on February 19.",

Sources indicate that individuals who headed ministries that remained above controversy, or those with a ‘clean image’, will be entrusted with various responsibilities.\n\nWhen contacted, BNP Standing Committee’s senior member Dr. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told The New Nation, “Everything including forming the BNP’s new government would be suitable for govern the country towards building a prosperous Bangladesh.”\n\nHe said, “What is needed for future Bangladesh, the BNP is preparing for those things.”\n\nAmong them, BNP Standing Committee Senior Member Dr. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain or the party’s Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir considered as the president.\n\nStanding Committee Member Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan is considered for the Parliament’s speaker.\n\nThe rest of the members of the party’s highest policy making body the Standing Committee Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Dr. Abdul Moyeen Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, Salahuddin Ahmed, Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, Major (retd) Hafiz Uddin Ahmed and Professor Dr. A.

    "body": "Diplomatic Correspondent :\n\nThe European Union Election Observation Mission has described 13th parliamentary election as genuinely competitive, credible and competently managed, marking what it called a pivotal step towards restoring democratic governance and the rule of law.\n\nPresenting the preliminary findings at a press conference at a city hotel in Dhaka on Saturday, Chief Observer Ivars Ijabs said the 12 February poll represented a significant departure from previous contests.\n\n“The 2026 parliamentary elections were credible and competently managed, marking a pivotal step towards restoring democratic governance and rule of law.\n\nFor the first time since 2008, elections were genuinely competitive, conducted under a renewed legal framework that largely accords with international standards and with fundamental freedoms broadly respected,” he said.\n\nHe added that the electoral framework, strengthened by recent amendments, provided a sound basis for democratic polls, though further reform would be necessary to enhance legal certainty and safeguard freedom of expression.\n\nAt the same time, the Chief Observer cautioned that shortcomings persisted. “Sporadic, localised political violence and persistent fear of mob attacks, often triggered by manipulated online narratives, harmed the democratic process,” Ijabs said.\n\nHe noted that at least 56 campaign-related violent incidents were reported across 27 districts, resulting in around 200 casualties.\n\nOn women’s participation, he said, “Only four per cent of the contestants were women, with BNP fielding 10, and NCP two candidates, while Jamaat-e-Islami and 30 other parties did not have any, evidencing a clear lack of political will to advance women in national politics, despite apparent commitments in the July Charter.”\n\nCommenting on the conduct of the poll, Ijabs said the Bangladesh Election Commission worked “independently and transparently, maintaining the confidence of stakeholders, and upholding the integrity of the polls.”\n\nHe praised the proactive approach of the newly appointed Commission in rebuilding public trust, while noting that some stringent campaign rules were not consistently enforced, leading to perceptions of an uneven playing field in certain constituencies.\n\nAbout Awami League activities during election, he said, “AL, which as a party was suspended from contesting the elections, and its affiliates continuously sought to undermine the Interim Government and the legitimacy of the elections.\n\nIn a concerted effort, AL-leaning social media accounts called for a boycott of the elections. Such efforts intensified in January; by election day, posts on TikTok with AL hashtags reached some 183 million views in total.”\n\nThe delegation of Members of the European Parliament, led by Tomáš Zdechovský, fully endorsed the mission’s preliminary statement.\n\n“The country is now entering a new crucial phase,” Zdechovský said. “We urge the new parliament and government, backed by all other state institutions, to implement the approved reforms.”\n\nResponding to questions, Ivars Ijabs said that although the election marked a significant democratic improvement, gender imbalance remained a serious concern.\n\n“Women’s participation is probably the issue that is of the greatest concern according to our observers,” he said, stressing that democracy is about civic equality and the right of every citizen to participate as a voter, candidate and campaigner.\n\nHe noted that limited female representation “hurts the decision-making of the Bangladeshi people themselves” and urged authorities to fulfil international commitments on women’s political inclusion.\n\nThe Chief Observer reiterated that the mission’s mandate was to assess the electoral process rather than broader political questions, including the exclusion of certain political parties, including Awami League.\n\nOn the referendum held alongside the parliamentary vote, he clarified that the European Union does not usually observe referendums and therefore it was not part of the mission’s mandate.\n\nAddressing concerns about turnout, Ijabs said the figure appeared to fall within Bangladesh’s historical range and cautioned against focusing solely on percentages.\n\n“We are not looking at turnout only as a number,” he said.\n\n“Turnout is very much also about participation – whether all relevant groups in society are taking part and no one is excluded.”\n\nHe confirmed that the EU EOM would publish a final report in late April or early May, consolidating its findings and offering recommendations.\n\nResponding to allegations of irregularities in vote counting in certain constituencies, Ijabs said the mission had not directly observed fraud or ballot stuffing.\n\n“I say with full responsibility that there was no direct observation of fraud or ballot stuffing,” he stated, while acknowledging that minor irregularities had been noted.\n\nLooking ahead, he emphasised that democratic responsibility continues after polling day. The new government, he said, must engage constructively with the opposition, while civil society and the media maintain oversight.\n\n“Opposition, civil society and media have an absolutely crucial role to control government,” he said, underlining that democracy is not a blank cheque for those in power.",

It will not be centered on any specific country,” he said.\n\nOn the ICT, Amir Khosru said the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the judiciary, indicating that the executive would not interfere in judicial decisions.\n\nTarique Rahman’s remarks came two days after the BNP secured more than a two-thirds majority in Thursday’s polls, clearing the way for government formation under his leadership.\n\nHe described the election as a restoration of democracy after what he termed years of authoritarian rule.\n\n“The victory belongs to Bangladesh, the victory belongs to democracy,” he said, calling on all political parties to unite in rebuilding the country.\n\nWhen asked by Khaled Mohiuddin of the New York-based Thikana about his earlier claim that the election would not be easy for the BNP—and whether any “engineering” had been required to secure more than 200 seats—Rahman rejected the suggestion of manipulation.\n\n“Convincing the people is our engineering,” he said. “Bringing the people to our side was our engineering. Alhamdulillah, we have succeeded in that.”\n\nHe acknowledged that creating a fair and peaceful electoral environment was challenging. “To achieve any good goal, hard work is necessary. It is never easy,” he said.\n\nQuestions on foreign relations continued, including from a journalist of The Independent in the UK, who asked how a BNP government would balance ties with India, Pakistan and China, and whether corruption cases involving former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her niece Tulip Siddiq would be pursued.\n\nAmir Khosru reiterated that BNP’s foreign policy would apply equally to all countries, guided by mutual interest and non-interference.\n\nOn legal cases, BNP leaders indicated that judicial processes would proceed according to law.\n\nResponding to a journalist from Al Jazeera about the main challenges facing the incoming government, Tarique Rahman identified the fragile economy, deteriorating law and order, and institutional politicization as key concerns.\n\n“The previous government politicized almost all institutions,” he said. “We must ensure good governance and restore professionalism.”\n\nOn economic reform, Rahman referred to BNP’s manifesto and its 31-point reform program, highlighting the concept of a “democratic economy.”\n\nHe said the party aims to dismantle oligarchic structures and create equal opportunities for all.\n\n“We want an economy where business and trade are conducted according to merit and qualification. We do not want to give long-term special advantages to any specific group,” he said.\n\nAddressing concerns about post-election unrest, Rahman called on party leaders and activists to remain peaceful and vigilant.\n\nHe said he had instructed BNP members not to organize victory processions despite their decisive mandate, to prevent any untoward incidents.\n\n“Peace and order must be maintained at any cost,” he said. “The law is equal for everyone. We will not tolerate injustice or illegal activities, regardless of party or opinion.”\n\nHe also paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in democratic movements from 1971 to recent years, and recalled the role of the late Khaleda Zia in opposing autocracy.\n\nThanking the interim government, Election Commission, law enforcement agencies and both local and foreign observers, Rahman described the election as peaceful, free and fair.",

    "body": "Staff Reporter :\n\nThe 11-party alliance led by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has announced a protest march in the capital on Monday in response to alleged post-election violence across the country. The procession is scheduled to begin after Asr prayers from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram.\n\nThe decision was taken at a meeting of the alliance’s liaison committee on Saturday evening, according to sources present at the meeting.\n\nLeaders expressed concern over incidents of violence reported in different parts of the country following the polls and resolved to hold the demonstration as a mark of protest.\n\nAlliance leaders claimed that several houses, family members, and business establishments of Jamaat and 11-party alliance activists have come under attack since the election.\n\nThey described the incidents as “brutal activities” and demanded a fair investigation and accountability for those responsible. Jamaat also cited at least 21 incidents of violence on election night, in addition to attacks reported before the vote.\n\nLeaders of the alliance alleged that activists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which is set to form the government after securing a sweeping victory, were involved in the violence. BNP has not publicly responded to the specific allegations as of Saturday evening.\n\nEarlier in the day, Jamaat Ameer Shafiqur Rahman issued a statement on Facebook addressing the Election Commission, the incoming government, BNP as a party, and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn his post, he said the Jamaat-led alliance recognizes the election results and respects the constitutional process, noting that the BNP-led bloc secured a parliamentary majority.\n\nHowever, he argued that the national vote reflects a more complex political reality. According to him, while BNP received around 54 percent of the vote, the Jamaat-led alliance secured nearly 40 percent, emerging as a significant national force.\n\nHe criticized the existing “first-past-the-post” electoral system, saying millions of votes do not receive proportional representation under the current situation.\n\nRahman stated that BNP won 53 seats by narrow margins ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand votes.\n\nSome of these constituencies are now under formal review by the Election Commission, he said, adding that the alliance would pursue all lawful avenues to ensure transparency and integrity in the questioned seats.\n\nHe emphasized that this effort does not amount to rejecting the overall national result but is aimed at safeguarding the credibility of the electoral process.\n\nCalling for transparency and accountability, Rahman urged the Election Commission to act with complete neutrality and law enforcement agencies to take firm action wherever allegations of violence, intimidation, or unlawful activities arise.\n\nHe also called on BNP’s leadership to demonstrate its commitment to constitutional governance and ensure that any party members found violating the law are held accountable without bias.\n\n“This is a moment that requires maturity and national responsibility,” he wrote, urging all sides to remain calm and move forward with restraint, integrity, and respect for democratic institutions.",

    "title": "New Cabinet: Can the State Forge a New Social Contract of Trust?",
    "body": "Prof. Dr. Md. Nazrul Islam Tamiji :\n\nChanges in power are not new in our country. But not all changes are the same. Some merely replace a government; others carry the potential to reshape the very character of the state.\n\nThe present moment places us before the latter possibility. Therefore, discussion about the new cabinet should not be confined to who gets which ministry.\n\nThe central question is how the relationship among the state, society and citizens will be restructured.\n\nThe founder of sociology, Auguste Comte, viewed society as a reality formed through a balance between order and progress.\n\nStability, he argued, is impossible without continuity, yet society cannot advance without change.\n\nBangladesh now faces precisely this dual challenge: rebuilding trust while maintaining continuity in governance.\n\nA state that remains static while people’s aspirations stagnate cannot sustain stability. Conversely, change that erodes institutional foundations invites disorder rather than development.\n\nKarl Marx explained that political structures ultimately reflect underlying social forces.\n\nA new government therefore generates new expectations—economic justice, equitable distribution of opportunity, and participatory development.\n\nCitizens no longer wish merely to hear promises; they want to see tangible outcomes: employment, fair wages, social protection and visible initiatives to reduce inequality.\n\nWhen expectations remain unmet, political change fails to translate into social transformation and instead breeds frustration and alienation.\n\nÉmile Durkheim emphasized the importance of social cohesion, arguing that societies endure through mutual trust and collective consciousness.\n\nIn Bangladesh, overcoming a long-standing culture of division, distrust and confrontation must be a central responsibility of new leadership.\n\nTrust in the state is essential, but so too is mutual respect among citizens. Democracy is not merely a voting mechanism; it is an ethical culture of coexistence.\n\nMax Weber highlighted the importance of rule-bound, rational authority in governance. Democracy cannot be strengthened unless institutions—not individuals—form the foundation of administration.\n\nWhen governance runs on loyalty rather than rules, development cannot be sustained.\n\nPersonalistic leadership may deliver quick results, but institutional governance builds lasting trust. Law, policy and accountability must function together for a modern state to succeed.\n\nHerbert Spencer likened society to a living organism, where balance among all parts is essential.\n\nEconomy, politics, education and culture are interdependent. Excessive expansion or neglect in any one sector weakens the whole system.\n\nDevelopment, therefore, cannot be measured solely by infrastructure or growth statistics; human capital, ethical values and good governance are equally vital.\n\nJane Addams, meanwhile, stressed a humane vision of the state, arguing that a nation’s success should be measured by improvements in the lives of its most marginalized citizens.\n\nThis perspective holds particular relevance for Bangladesh, where rural–urban disparities, youth unemployment and social security challenges remain pressing concerns.\n\nAt this juncture, the most important question confronting the new cabinet is whether it will signal change merely through administrative reshuffling, or whether it will cultivate a new political culture grounded in policy reform, participation and accountability.\n\nIf the state can establish genuine dialogue with citizens—listening, understanding and responding—this transition could become a transformative chapter in history.\n\nBangladesh’s political past teaches us that changes of power are fleeting, but institutional reforms endure.\n\nWhat is needed today is a governing philosophy in which development is reflected not only in numbers but in people’s lives; where the strength of the state safeguards rather than constrains citizens’ freedoms; and where dissent is treated not as conflict, but as a sign of democratic maturity.\n\nThis moment, therefore, is not merely the beginning of another government. It could be a historic opportunity to redefine the relationship between state and society.\n\nThe true success of change will depend on whether we seek only a transfer of power—or a transformation in the culture of governance.\n\nCurrent political discussions surrounding a possible new administrative arrangement reflect these sociological ideas in practice.\n\nConversations about a potential government led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party suggest an attempt to balance experience with a new generation of leadership.\n\nWhile the name of Tarique Rahman is circulating in political discourse as a possible prime minister, no formal announcement has yet been made—an entirely normal feature of democratic process.\n\nHowever intense public expectations may be, decisions reached through constitutional procedures and political consensus remains hallmarks of an institutional state.\n\nThis interim period should thus be viewed not as uncertainty, but as preparation for political transition.\n\nSenior leaders are being discussed for key roles, reflecting expectations of administrative continuity and reform.\n\nSpeculation about experienced figures in local government, public works, foreign affairs, law, public administration and economic management signals a desire to reconnect governance with institutional capacity and policy coherence.\n\nIn particular, economic leadership will be critical amid global pressures, inflation, foreign exchange challenges and the need to create an investment-friendly environment.\n\nSuch roles are not merely administrative—they embody the state’s development philosophy.\n\nDiscussions also point to the possible inclusion of technocrats alongside political leaders, indicating an effort to combine professional expertise with political experience.\n\nThe inclusion of trusted associates of past leadership, participation of alliance partners, and representation of younger voices suggest an attempt at broader political accommodation and intergenerational dialogue.\n\nEmphasis on labor markets and employment generation further reflects the demographic reality of Bangladesh.\n\nA youthful population represents both immense potential and, if neglected, significant pressure.\n\nPolicies focused on skills development, domestic job creation, technology-driven training and expansion of overseas employment could strengthen both economic resilience and social stability.\n\nTaken together, these discussions are not merely about allocating portfolios; they foreshadow the state’s future priorities.\n\nA government becomes historically significant when it not only organizes administration but also builds new foundations of public trust, economic justice and institutional capability.\n\nIn sociological terms, this moment may be understood as a search for a new social contract.\n\nCitizens now demand not rhetoric but functioning institutions, accountable administration and inclusive development that creates opportunities for all. Without making citizens genuine partners, political legitimacy cannot endure.\n\nBangladesh now faces three fundamental questions:\n\nFirst, will governance shift from personality-centered to institution-centered practice?\n\nSecond, will development become genuinely inclusive?\n\nThird, can politics move from a culture of confrontation to one of cooperation?\n\nSociology offers a simple lesson that the strength of a state lies not in its power, but in its legitimacy.\n\nIf new leadership prioritizes rebuilding trust, this political transition could mark a positive turning point in history. Otherwise, it will remain just another episode of power.\n\nBangladesh today stands before that choice—and before the opportunity to write its next chapter.\n\n(The author is a Poet, Sociologist & Chairman of National Human\n\nRights Society)",

    "body": "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is going to form the government for the fourth time after a long 20 years, winning an absolute majority in the 13th national parliamentary election held on Thursday.\n\nThe Election Commission has announced the official results of 297 seats. BNP as a single party won 209 seats and its allies secured 3 more.\n\nOn the other hand, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami won 68 seats. In addition, the National Citizens Party got 6 seats and its allies achieved 3 more.\n\nThe Islamic Movement Bangladesh gained 1 seat while the Independents 7 seats, according to the Election Commission’s unofficial announcement yesterday.\n\nIt is to be noted that to form a government, a victory in at least 151 out of 300 parliamentary seats is required.\n\nThe BNP has fulfilled the constitutional conditions to form a government on its own. BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman would be the country’s next Prime Minister.\n\nTarique Rahman has won both Dhaka-17 and Bogura-6 constituencies by a huge margin. This is his first time participating in the national elections.\n\nMentionable, the 13th National Parliament Election and the referendum on the implementation of the July Charter reform proposal were held in a peaceful and encouraging atmosphere on Thursday.\n\nAlthough there were reports of some isolated irregularities and violence, there were no reports of major disruptions to the overall voting pattern.\n\nFor this, the government deserves appreciation for organizing a fair, peaceful and acceptable election for the nation.\n\nThe July mass uprising of 24 has created an opportunity for Bangladesh to return to democracy.\n\nIn brief, the BNP was founded by Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman. Later, former Prime Minister and BNPChairperson Khaleda Zia took the party to the peak of popularity.\n\nAfter leading the anti-dictatorship movement for nine years, she won the 1991 election and became the country’s first female prime minister.\n\nTarique Rahman returned to the country on November 25 last year, ending a long 17-year exile, and was included in the voter list on November 27.\n\nHis formal political journey began in 1988 as a member of the BNP in GabtoliUpazila of Bogura.\n\nHe was elected as the party’s Senior Joint Secretary General in 2002 and Senior Vice Chairman in 2009.\n\nHe took over as the acting chairman after Khaleda Zia was imprisoned in 2018.It is worth noting that Khaleda Zia passed away on December 30.\n\nThen, on January 9, the party’s standing committee formally recognized Tarique Rahman as its chairman.\n\nThe people of the countryhope that the journey of transition to democracy that began with Thursday’s elections will continue. May this journey of democracy be strengthenedfurther overcoming everychallenges.",

    "body": "It is deeply disappointing that although the authoritarian Hasina government has fallen during the August mass uprising 2024, the culture of impunity and the dysfunction of state institutions continue to exist.\n\nThe most shameful chapter of the human rights situation in 2025 was ‘mob violence’ and lynching.\n\nThe grim picture has been presented in the annual reports of the country’s three leading human rights organizations — ASK, MSF, and HRSS – at the end of 2025.\n\nAccording to ASK, 197 people were killed in mob beatings over the course of the year — nearly double the number recorded the previous year.\n\nWhen people are beaten to death despite pleading for their lives with folded hands, in the face of police inaction, it becomes clear that even the most minimal trust of citizens in the state has eroded.\n\nVandalising shrines in the name of so-called ‘Tawhidi mobs’, attacking Baul singers, and forming mobs to demolish art and culture centres can in no way be signs of a non-discriminatory state.\n\nAccording to the organisations’ data, the number of deaths in prisons and in the custody of law enforcement agencies is also alarming.\n\nThese incidents occurred in law enforcement custody, as a result of torture, or under the pretext of so-called ‘crossfire’, ‘shootouts’, or “gunfights’. Such deaths turn the commitment to ensuring the rule of law into a mockery.\n\nThe MSF report documents 641 cases of unidentified bodies recovered throughout the year.\n\nDespite extensive police patrols and surveillance, the administration has no satisfactory explanation for how hundreds of bodies — many with hands and feet bound or stuffed into sacks — continue to be found.\n\nIn addition, more than a hundred deaths due to political violence, and particularly the loss of 39 lives in internal clashes within the BNP, demonstrate a severe lack of tolerance even within political parties themselves.\n\nBesides, according to ASK and MSF, between 400 and 600 journalists have faced torture and harassment.\n\nWe believe that various forms of disorder may emerge in the aftermath of a mass uprising, but such a situation cannot be allowed to persist for a year and a half.\n\nEvery incident of mob violence or extrajudicial killing is, in reality, a reflection of the government’s failure.\n\nThe administration and law enforcement agencies cannot continue to rely on ‘old excuses’.\n\nIf the real perpetrators are not swiftly brought to justice and police inaction is not addressed, this anarchy will engulf the entire state.\n\nThus, the just elected BNP party MPs who are going to take oath within days have to take steps so that such occurrences do not recur.",

    "title": "The Lost Future of Our Youth:Will the New Government Open the Door of Hope",
    "body": "Abubokor Hanip:\n\nNot long ago, a post on Facebook shook me. A Bangladeshi man in France shared that he earned 169 euros- about 21,000 taka- after driving Uber for 12 hours. He wrote with pride, saying this is why he risked his life crossing the sea. In his mind, that backbreaking shift was worth more than a whole month’s struggle in Bangladesh.\n\nThat story carries the bitter taste of truth. But should risking your life on a dark sea ever be the price of dignity? To him it seemed the only path. But deep down we know—this is not the future our youth deserve.\n\nSo, the question burns: what future are we offering our young people?\n\nGraduates with prized degrees roam without work. Those who do find jobs are underpaid, undervalued, and crushed by frustration. No wonder driving for minimum wage abroad feels like “success.” No wonder more than half of our youth dream of leaving the country. A British Council report shows 55% want to go abroad for study or work. Forty-two percent worry about unemployment. One-third of unemployed educated youth drift into crime.\n\nTell me, how long can a nation survive like this?\n\nAnd if they do go abroad, are they destined only to drive Ubers and wash dishes? Is that the sum of their talent and ambition? Absolutely not. Our youth are not meant for scraps. They are meant to lead, to create, to compete at the highest levels of the global economy.\n\nYet, right now, too many are simply stuck. A survey shows 40% of Bangladeshi youth are “inactive”- not in school, not in training, not in work. Among young women, that number climbs past 60%. Numbers like these should break our pride into pieces.\n\nWe often boast of the “demographic dividend.” We talk about our youth as our strength. But what good is a dividend if we don’t invest it wisely? What good is a dream if it ends in despair?\n\nHere is the root: our education system. It produces degrees, but not the skills employers demand. That is why so many graduates sit idle. That is why the best minds pack their bags.\n\nThe solution is not charity. The solution is not blind hope. The solution is skills- real, work-ready skills. Education that matches the market. Classrooms that prepare students not for unemployment, but for contribution.\n\nAt Washington University of Science and Technology in the US, we built such a model. It is simple but powerful: Degree, Skills, Career. Students don’t just memorize. They practice. They learn from professors who are also industry experts, who bring 18 years of real-world experience straight into the classroom. The class becomes a workplace. The workplace becomes a future.\n\nWhy is this urgent? Because the world has already changed. Entry-level jobs are vanishing—swallowed by AI. Generative AI agents now do the simple tasks that once gave millions a living. Survival now demands higher-level skills. Only those who master the new tools will thrive.\n\nBangladesh cannot wait. We need a revolution in our universities. AI, machine learning, big data, cybersecurity, cloud, fintech, green energy, digital health, creative media- these must be our frontlines. If we do not prepare, we will be left behind.\n\nFrom my two and a half decades of experience, I can identify the key sectors Bangladesh must prioritize:\n\n1.Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Agentic AI, Computer Vision, NLP\n\n2.Machine Learning & Deep Learning – Predictive Analysis, Automation\n\n3.Data Science & Big Data\n\n4.IT & Software Development – Programming, Cybersecurity\n\n5.Cloud Computing & DevOps\n\n6.FinTech & Digital Finance\n\n7.Digital Marketing & Content Creation\n\n8.Healthcare & Medical Technology\n\n9.Green Energy & Environmental Technology\n\n10.Construction & Engineering Tech\n\n11.Agricultural Technology\n\n12.Creative Media & Entertainment\n\n13.Business & Project Management\n\n14.Textile & Garments High-Tech\n\n15.Transport & Logistics\n\nJust imagine the opposite. Imagine a Bangladesh where every graduate leaves not just with a certificate, but with skills employers trust. Where students build personal brands online, speak fluent English, and connect with the global marketplace. Where they don’t chase jobs, but create them- through innovation, entrepreneurship, and courage.\n\nThis is not a fantasy. With the right changes, the 3.4 million students of our National University system alone could become the greatest workforce engine in South Asia. Give them direction, give them training, give them hope- and they will build a new Bangladesh with their own hands.\n\nAnd here is the truth I believe with all my heart: our youth are not a burden. They are not statistics. They are a storm of energy, a force of dreams, a river of possibility. They are the spark that can set this nation ablaze with progress.\n\nThe new government has a choice. They can let despair fester- or they can light the flame of trust. They can open the door of hope. If they choose the latter, our youth will rise- not as job seekers, but as leaders. Not as wanderers, but as world citizens.\n\nThe future of Bangladesh is not written in fear. It is waiting in the hands of our youth. Give them the skills. Give them the faith. And watch them transform this nation into one that doesn’t just survive- but leads.\n\nThe writer is the Chairman & Chancellor of Washington University of Science and Technology, and the Founder & CEO of PeopleNTech.",

    "body": "Although Bangladesh has significant potential for investment, poor infrastructure, bureaucratic obstacles, corruption, political instability, lack of access to finance and regulatory hurdles remain concerns.\n\nAccording to businesspeople and experts at the Bangladesh Startup Connect 2025 meeting held on the sidelines of the Bangladesh Investment Summit Tuesday mentioned that the above barriers have given rise to an unfavourable business environment in the country.\n\nForeign investors, on the other hand, want the government to ensure policy predictability in order to retain the investors’ confidence. When they commit investments, they do it on the basis of the prevailing rules and regulations. If those laws are changed abruptly, uncertainties and risks are created; it was remarked by the discussants.\n\nIt is to be noted that the event was arranged with a view to showcasing local startups, fostering close-border collaborations, and unlocking new investment opportunities. The main panellists included Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, executive chairman of Bida, Ahsan H Mansur, governor of Bangladesh Bank, and Shish Haider Chowdhury, secretary of the ICT Division.\n\nIn order to build up an investment-friendly culture, a stable and corruption-free environment for business must first be created. Investment security and the scope for businesspersons’ licensing rights must be ensured. Above all, the government too must continuously make sincere efforts to attract investors.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s 2024 World Investment Report, foreign direct investment (FDI) declined by 2.5 percent worldwide in 2023, while Bangladesh’s fell by 14.5 percent.\n\nBangladesh received $3 billion in foreign investment in 2023, while India received $28.16 billion, Vietnam $18.5 billion, Indonesia $21.63 billion, Cambodia $3.96 billion, and Pakistan $1.82 billion. Foreign investment in Bangladesh is always considered lower than expected.\n\nIf we want to attract investment in competition with other countries, we must update our existing policies, and improve our education standard. Our regulatory bodies need to move away from the ‘licence-boss’ attitude and become business-friendly and step up use of technology.\n\nAttention must also be paid to ensure that companies can get good returns on their investment, that they can easily repatriate their returns and get justice in legal lawsuits. And there should also be no discrimination among the local and foreign companies.",

Instead, they want change and reform in state structure”.News BSS\n\nHe made the remarks at a press briefing at the Foreign Service Academy here this morning.\n\nNoting that responsibility for implementing the clear public mandate for reform now rests with the political parties, Prof Riaz said all political parties are committed to state reform.\n\nHe called on the ruling party-elect, parties to be representing in parliament and the Constitutional Reform Council, as well as parties outside parliament, to ensure implementation of the referendum verdict through dialogue and unity.\n\nProf Riaz also urged political parties to continue the respect for differing opinions, tolerance, and tradition of compromise that was demonstrated during discussions at the National Consensus Commission.\n\n“The verdict represents recognition of the responsibility entrusted to us by those who gave their lives, were injured, and fought fearlessly during the July–August mass uprising in 2024. It reflects the people’s commitment to fulfilling that responsibility,” he said.\n\nFollowing the nearly 16 years marked by bloodshed, repression, and the cries of the persecuted, Prof Riaz said the referendum expressed a people’s aspiration for forming an institutional framework so that such suffering is never repeated.\n\n“The responsibility of implementing the people-endorsed document, drafted by the political parties themselves, now lies on you,” he said referring to the political parties.\n\nProf Riaz also called on civil society to support and advance the process.\n\nAddressing young people in particular, he urged them to take the lead in building the future Bangladesh.\n\nReferring to the figures of voter turnout in the referendum, Prof Riaz stressed that the referendum result should not be viewed merely in numerical terms.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to all for extending the wide-ranging support during the awareness campaign on referendum.\n\nProf Riaz specially mentioned the families of the July martyrs, July fighters, July political detainees, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, Sushashoner Jonno Nagorik (SUJAN), groups advocating for increasing the age limit for government jobs, and general students, saying, they took the initiative to organize and campaign actively in support of the referendum.\n\nHe also thanked media professionals and journalists for their efforts in creating public awareness about the referendum and expressed appreciation for those who criticized the procedures and methods of the referendum, stating that all voices—positive and negative—are essential elements of a democratic society.\n\nProf Riaz congratulated the newly elected Members of Parliament and their respective political parties.\n\nHe also congratulated the public for participating in large numbers in what he described as a genuine election after a long period, thereby defeating all forms of conspiracy and fears of violence.\n\nReplying to a question from a journalist whether BNP would implement all the reforms contained in the July Charter, Prof Riaz said he hoped BNP would show respect to the people’s mandate as it has previous records of adopting major reforms initiatives.\n\nChief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam and Deputy Press Secretary Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad Majumder were present at the briefing.",

On Sunday alone, more than fifty Palestinians, including women and children, were killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza.\n\nUNICEF has warned that at least 100 children are being killed every day since the renewed attacks began on March 18.\n\nMore than a million children in Gaza have been without life-saving aid for more than a month. The basic rights of the Palestinian people are being grossly violated.\n\nOne day the crimes committed by Israel, which deserves to be considered a despicable nation, will be written in the pages of history.\n\nWe hope that the world leaders will take effective steps to restore peace in Gaza through a united effort, not for the lust of power, but for the sake of humanity.",

But in January, he announced that he would impose tariffs on countries trading with Iran.\n\nChina, which is at the forefront of these countries, has warned that it will defend its interests.\n\nOther major markets for Chinese products, such as the European Union, are alarmed by the imbalance in their trade balance with China.\n\nEuropeans, concerned that their markets will serve as an outlet for Chinese production surpluses, are urging China to stimulate its domestic consumption, which has been sluggish for years.\n\nThe WTO is holding its ministerial conference, its biennial main gathering, in late March in Cameroon.",

Experts warn that Iran’s large missile arsenal could threaten US forces and bases across the region.\n\nThe White House said Trump is considering all options regarding Iran but will make a final decision based on US national security interests. The Pentagon declined to comment on the operational planning.\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has warned that any strike on Iranian territory would be met with retaliation against US bases in the Middle East, including those in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTehran says it is open to negotiations on limits to its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, but it has ruled out linking the talks to its missile programme.",

    "body": "Sakif Shamim has officially inaugurated VirtuED, recognized as Asia’s first medical anatomy learning app. This launch marks the formal journey of VirtucareBD, an initiative dedicated to overcoming the long-standing limitations of the healthcare sector in Bangladesh by establishing a modern, technology-driven, and smart health system. The platform aims to integrate world-class technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) directly into mainstream medicine. This integration is set to begin a new era in complex surgery, advanced diagnosis, and digital patient management, ultimately elevating the standards of the national public health system to an international level. Additionally, VirtucareBD has introduced surgical simulation and virtual hospital concepts to make medical education and services more realistic and accessible.\n\nVirtucareBD functions as a high-tech ecosystem that creates a bridge between traditional medical methods and modern science. Its methodology is not limited to theoretical education but provides support at every level of clinical practice. Through AR technology, doctors can now observe a patient’s complex internal structures in 3D before performing surgery. This serves as a digital map for surgeons, reducing the possibility of errors and ensuring patient safety. Furthermore, VR creates an artificial environment where young physicians can practice complex medical procedures repeatedly without any risk. As a result, the quality of patient care in hospitals increases significantly, and doctors can work with greater confidence.\n\nThe flagship component of this ecosystem, VirtuED, is Asia’s first immersive digital anatomy learning platform. Through this app, medical students have the opportunity to learn complex human anatomy using AR, VR, and 3D visualization. VirtuED moves medical education beyond the limitations of textbooks to create an interactive and future-oriented learning experience. During the inauguration, Sakif Shamim, the Managing Director of VirtucareBD and Deputy Managing Director of Labaid, stated that this is not just a single technology initiative. Instead, it is a well-planned effort to establish scientific standards in the health sector by unifying global medical data, modern research, and future-ready technology. He further mentioned that the core philosophy and goal of VirtucareBD are to improve the quality of medical education, increase physician skills, and ensure patient safety through data-driven decisions, immersive simulation, and remote assistance.\n\nThe event was attended by renowned physicians from various Labaid Group institutions as well as prominent experts from leading hospitals across the country. Through the active participation and exchange of views among experts in medical education, surgery, oncology, and digital health, the launch of VirtucareBD was recognized as a significant and timely initiative. To reach the top of the healthcare sector in the near future, VirtucareBD is making large investments in its Research and Development (R&D) department. The platform’s tele-assistance technology is expected to bring a radical change to healthcare in rural and suburban areas. Through this, specialists from the capital or abroad can provide direct guidance to local doctors in complex situations using AR devices.\n\nThese technological advancements are expected to establish VirtucareBD as one of the most influential health-tech brands in South Asia. The platform is built on the belief that advanced technology should not be for expensive hospitals alone but should reach the doorsteps of ordinary people. Using this platform will increase the skills of doctors and allow the general public to receive advanced medical services at affordable prices. This transformation of the health sector is an essential part of fulfilling the dream of a Digital Bangladesh. This bold initiative by VirtucareBD will introduce Bangladeshi doctors to international-standard innovation and play a leading role in building a prosperous, disease-free country.\n\nThe app is available for download at the following link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Virtucarebd.VirtuED.",

    "body": "The reaction seen in the country’s capital market after the announcement of the 13th national election results is being considered one of the biggest surges in recent times.\n\nOn the first trading day (Sunday) after the election, the strong jump in the index at the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), the sharp increase in turnover, and the upward trend in share prices of most companies proved how quickly the capital market can respond positively when political uncertainty recedes.\n\nAt the end of the day, the benchmark DSEX index rose to 5,600.65 points. Compared to the previous trading day, the index increased by 200.72 points, or 3.71%.\n\nThe second index, DSES, rose by more than 30 points, while the DS30 index, comprising the top 30 companies, gained 86 points.\n\nSuch a broad-based rise in a single day has not been seen in recent months.\n\nHighest turnover in five months\n\nNot only the index, but trading activity also regained momentum. Total turnover at the DSE exceeded Tk1,275 crore at the end of the day.\n\nOn the previous trading day, turnover was around Tk790 crore, meaning an increase of nearly Tk485 crore in a single day.\n\nThis was the highest turnover since September 8 last year.\n\nMarket analysts said this surge in turnover proves that not only did prices rise, but active participation in the market also increased.\n\nThis indicates that the rise was not artificial or driven by a limited group, but reflected broad-based participation.\n\nMarket capitalization also increased by about Tk12,305 crore in a single day. It rose from Tk708,977 crore on the previous trading day to Tk721,282 crore at the end of the day.\n\nThis increase signals a positive impact on the overall valuation of the country’s corporate sector.\n\nExpectations\n\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured an absolute victory in the election. The party is led by Tarique Rahman. Its election manifesto promised economic reforms, good governance in the banking sector, anti-corruption measures, an investment-friendly environment, and increased employment.\n\nMarket participants said the peaceful completion of the election and the likelihood of swift government formation have created new confidence among investors.\n\nBefore the election, prolonged stagnation persisted in the market due to political uncertainty, high interest rates, liquidity shortages, instability in the dollar market, and weaknesses in the banking sector.\n\nMany investors had stayed on the sidelines to avoid risk.\n\nAfter the announcement of the results, they began repositioning themselves in the market. Those who had been waiting for a long time viewed this as an entry point.\n\nSector-wise analysis\n\nDuring the day’s trading, shares of banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, and large-cap firms saw the strongest buying pressure.\n\nThe banking sector effectively pulled the market upward.\n\nCity Bank topped the turnover list, followed by Dhaka Bank and Square Pharmaceuticals. BRAC Bank, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation, Robi, Saiham Cotton, Jamuna Bank, Islami Bank, and Orion Infusion also recorded notable trading.\n\nIn terms of price gains, One Bank, Munno Fabrics, LankaBangla Finance, Asia Insurance, and Daffodil Computers led the list. Most of their share prices rose between 9 and 10 percent, the maximum daily limit. Shares of nearly 75 companies hit circuit breakers.\n\nOut of 364 companies, share and unit prices increased, while only 26 declined. Prices of four remained unchanged. Even a large portion of Z-category companies (non-dividend paying firms) saw their share prices rise, indicating an overall positive market sentiment.\n\nPositive momentum in CTG as well\n\nThe same trend was seen at the Chittagong Stock Exchange.\n\nThe overall index CASPI rose by about 484 points. Turnover increased to Tk24.65 crore, nearly two and a half times higher than the previous day.\n\n‘Relief rally’\n\nSome market analysts described the surge as a “relief rally.” Such sharp increases are often seen as a reaction of relief after prolonged political uncertainty and policy ambiguity.\n\nHowever, they cautioned that structural reforms are essential to sustain this momentum.\n\nKey challenges include controlling default loans in the banking sector, resolving liquidity shortages, ensuring stability in interest rate policy, maintaining balance in the dollar market, strengthening corporate governance, increasing institutional investment, and bringing quality IPOs to the market.\n\nDSE officials said the government must take visible reform measures quickly to sustain the positive momentum.\n\nStrict action to stop bank looting and ensure transparency in the financial sector is especially necessary.\n\nReflection of expectations, but with caution\n\nAccording to analysts, the message of political stability through a peaceful election has positively influenced investor confidence.\n\nHowever, sustained growth will require economic reforms, transparency in interest rate policy, stability in the dollar market, and effective steps to increase institutional investment.\n\nDSE director Md Shakil Rizvi said investor confidence has returned as there was no major violence surrounding the election. To maintain this positive trend, it is essential to bring IPOs of good companies and ensure governance in the market.\n\nDBA president Saiful Islam said stability would return if the new government fulfills its promises regarding the stock market. Quick reform initiatives are necessary to restore investor confidence.\n\nMacroeconomic context\n\nThe capital market does not move solely on political signals; it also reflects macroeconomic realities.\n\nCurrently, challenges include high inflation, pressure on foreign exchange reserves, import restrictions, and stagnation in private sector investment.\n\nIf the new government quickly announces policies for an investment-friendly budget, expansion of industrial production, and export growth, the foundation of confidence in the capital market will strengthen further.\n\nThe strong reaction in the capital market on the first trading day after the election undoubtedly carries a positive message. The day’s trading proved that investors become active quickly once political uncertainty subsides.\n\nHowever, sustained growth will require consistent policies, good governance, and economic reforms.\n\nAttention will now focus on how quickly the new government implements its promised reforms and how effectively it integrates the capital market into the economic mainstream.",

    "body": "A high-voltage India–Pakistan match in the T20 World Cup is set to unfold in Sri Lanka on Sunday, renewing one of cricket’s most storied rivalries.\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has permitted players on this tour to be accompanied by their wives or partners.\n\nAmong those drawing attention off the field is Indian all-rounder Hardik Himanshu Pandya, who is joined by his girlfriend, Mahieka Sharma. The couple has been in the spotlight ahead of the much-awaited match, adding to the buzz surrounding the contest.\n\nPandya has also been making headlines beyond cricketing matters. On the occasion of Valentine’s Day, the star cricketer unveiled a special tattoo dedicated to his partner — a gesture that quickly went viral on social media.\n\nAccording to the team of tattoo artist Sunny Bhanushali, Pandya had initially planned a subtle tribute. However, after further discussions, the concept evolved into a more meaningful and symbolic design. Rather than featuring a single letter, the final artwork depicts two cheetahs. One symbolizes strength, confidence, and resilience, while the other circles around it, subtly forming the letter “M”, a clear reference to Mahieka. The tattoo artist described it as a symbol of a relationship in which two people amplify each other’s strength.\n\nAfter his separation from his first wife, Hardik Pandya, was reportedly linked to singer Jasmin Walia. Following reports that the relationship had ended, Pandya is now said to be dating model and actress Mahieka Sharma.\n\nMahieka was raised in Delhi and completed her schooling at Navy Children School. She later pursued a degree in Economics and Finance. An academically accomplished student, she scored a perfect 10 CGPA in her Class 10 board examinations. During her college years, she undertook internships across diverse sectors, including economics, education, oil and gas strategy and planning.\n\nAfter completing her education, Mahieka transitioned into the showbiz industry, beginning her career in acting and modelling. She appeared in a music video by Indian rapper Raftaar and went on to take on minor roles in projects such as Into the Dark, directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Orlando von Einsiedel, and PM Narendra Modi, directed by Omung Kumar and starring Vivek Oberoi in the lead role.\n\nIn addition to her acting assignments, Mahieka has also featured in advertising campaigns for several leading brands, further establishing her presence in the modelling industry.",

There is no scope to present it otherwise,” she added.\n\nOn the election issue, the adviser said it has already been decided that future national elections will be held under a non-partisan government.\n\nThe caretaker government system has been reinstated following a court directive, and subsequent elections will be conducted under that framework, she added.",

    "body": "Law Adviser Asif Nazrul on Sunday said the idea of holding the oath-taking ceremony of the new cabinet members at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad was initially expressed by the BNP.\n\n“My understanding is that this parliament is somewhat different. We attained this parliament through the sacrifices of students and the masses in July, through a mass uprising marked by immense sacrifice, hardship, pain and loss of lives. That is why this parliament is a little different from all others,” he told reporters at the Bangladesh Secretariat.\n\nBesides, many historic events, including the July Declaration and the July Charter, have taken place in the parliament complex, said the adviser.\n\n“The South Plaza of this parliament is particularly memorable to us for various reasons. The funeral prayer of our late leader Begum Khaleda Zia was held at a nearby place, as was the funeral of our beloved martyr Osman Hadi,” he added.\n\nAsif Nazrul said South Plaza had also emerged as a venue for documenting various aspects of the July mass uprising. “Considering all these factors, they perhaps expressed this intention, and we arranged it accordingly.”\n\nThe adviser said a farewell meeting was held earlier in the day, but no major decisions were taken. “We reflected on our work, shared experiences, and informed everyone about the oath program. It was more like a final meeting together.”\n\n“The cabinet oath-taking ceremony will be held at the South Plaza at 4pm. As far as I know, the president is scheduled to administer the oath,” Nazrul said.\n\nAsked about invitees, he said those customarily invited under convention would be invited, and the Cabinet Division is handling the matter.\n\nOn whether the Indian prime minister would attend, he said he had no such information. “What I have heard so far is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed the foreign ministers of Saarc countries. I have no information about any prime minister attending,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about speculations that he might be included in the next cabinet the law adviser said: “There is no question at all.”",

    "body": "The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has directed that academic activities for students of class six to ten remain suspended nationwide during the upcoming month of Ramadan, beginning February 18.\n\nThe order was issued on Sunday by a High Court Division bench comprising Justice Fahmida Kader and Justice Md. Asif Hasan following a preliminary hearing on a writ petition.\n\nThe court also instructed the Education Secretary to implement the directive and issued a rule asking the authorities to explain why academic activities for these classes should not remain closed during Ramadan.\n\nIn a separate order, the court issued another rule questioning the legality of a notification by the Ministry of Education concerning the closure of madrasas and junior secondary schools during the holy month.\n\nAdvocate Ilias Ali Mondol appeared for the petitioner, assisted by Advocates Tanjina Bobby Liza and Md. Bayezid.\n\nEarlier, on January 5, petitioner Ilias Ali Mondol served a legal notice on the government regarding the matter. After receiving no response, he filed a writ petition with the High Court on January 20.\n\nThe legal notice stated that the majority of Bangladesh’s population is Muslim and that educational institutions have traditionally remained closed during Ramadan since independence. It argued that this long-standing practice constitutes established law, custom, and policy.\n\nCiting Articles 31 and 152(1) of the Constitution, the notice contended that any government decision to keep primary and secondary schools open during Ramadan would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe notice further argued that young students attending school throughout the day while fasting may experience physical strain, potentially discouraging them from observing the religious practice. It also claimed that keeping schools open during Ramadan could exacerbate traffic congestion in urban areas, causing public inconvenience.\n\nFollowing the government’s failure to respond to the notice, the writ petition was subsequently filed before the High Court.",

Indeed, it is a resounding call for change. Citizens of this country have become weary of entrenched dysfunction and are now demanding a new architecture of governance, rejecting the inertia of the past.\n\nIndeed, the responsibility is now with the newly elected BNP government - it is they who have been trusted to deliver the reforms that can reshape our state.\n\nThat more than 48 million voters chose reform tells us that we must remember the sacrifices made during the Monsoon Revolution of 2024 and treat reforms as a moral obligation.\n\nThe BNP government must therefore now act with urgency and clarity. Establishing an upper house of parliament, strengthening checks and balances, and ensuring accountability in public institutions are imperative to a better functioning Bangladesh.\n\nDialogue across party lines is also essential, as urged by Professor Ali Riaz. Reform cannot be monopolized by one political camp and will only be possible through collective political will and treated as a collective national project.\n\nThe referendum has given Bangladesh a rare moment of unity and squandering it would set us back once again. As such, we expect the BNP to resist the temptation of partisan triumphalism and instead embrace the responsibility of stewardship.\n\nBangladesh itself has been handed a historic opportunity and the administration must seize it - boldly, transparently, and inclusively. Anything less would betray the trust of millions who voted “yes.”",

The court granted the request and fixed January 15 for receiving the chargesheet.\n\nOn that day, Abdullah Al Jaber formally filed an objection, stating dissatisfaction with the DB-submitted chargesheet. Following the objection, the court ordered the CID to reinvestigate the case.\n\nHadi, who rose to prominence through the July uprising and the movement to ban the Awami League, had announced his intention to contest the 13th parliamentary election as an independent candidate from Dhaka-8 constituency.\n\nOn December 12, Hadi was shot in the head while conducting a public outreach campaign in the Bijoynagar area.

    "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is poised to return to power after two decades, having secured an absolute majority in the 13th National Parliamentary Election. The newly elected Members of Parliament, along with members of the incoming cabinet, are scheduled to take their oaths next Tuesday.\n\nAs political discussions intensify over the composition of the new cabinet, a recent announcement by Jamaat leader and lawyer of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, Shishir Monir, regarding the formation of a “shadow cabinet” has triggered fresh debate across political circles.\n\nAdvocate Mohammad Shishir Monir, who contested the Sunamganj-2 (Dirai–Shalla) constituency as a candidate of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami in the 13th parliamentary election, was defeated in the race. The constituency comprises parts of Sunamganj district, including the upazilas of Dirai and Shalla.\n\nShishir Monir announced plans to form a shadow cabinet in a post on his verified Facebook page on Saturday night, stating, “We will form a shadow cabinet, Insha’Allah.”\n\nThe announcement has generated renewed interest among political circles and the wider public. Speculation intensified further following a similar statement by Asif Mahmud Sajeeb Bhuiyan, spokesperson for the National Citizen Party (NCP).\n\nOn Sunday morning, Asif Mahmud wrote on Facebook, “We are preparing to form a shadow cabinet. The shadow cabinet will act as a watchdog to ensure transparency and accountability and to oversee overall activities.”\n\nWhat is a shadow cabinet?\n\nIn global politics, the concept of a “shadow cabinet” is closely associated with parliamentary systems modeled on the Westminster system. Opposition parties in such countries often appoint their own shadow cabinets to monitor, critique, and propose alternatives to government policies.\n\nA shadow cabinet typically consists of opposition members assigned to “shadow” each government ministry. These shadow ministers analyze government policies and budgets, raise critiques, and, where necessary, present alternative proposals.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the shadow cabinet regularly monitors government activities and ensures accountability by questioning ministers in Parliament. Similarly, in Australia, shadow cabinets play a vital role in scrutinizing government decisions.\n\nPolitical analysts note that a shadow cabinet is more than just a tool for criticism. It also serves as a training ground for opposition leaders, allowing party members to gain practical experience in administrative structures, budgeting, and policy-making processes—preparing them for potential future governance.\n\nA well-organized shadow cabinet enables opposition parties to present themselves to the public as capable, responsible, and ready to govern, reinforcing their image as a government-in-waiting.\n\nBangladesh Context\n\nIn Bangladesh, the formation of a shadow cabinet has never been formally implemented. The country’s current political framework does not mandate the creation of such a body. Nevertheless, political experts have long emphasized that establishing a shadow cabinet could strengthen parliamentary democracy.\n\nAnalysts note that a shadow cabinet serves as a vital mechanism for ensuring accountability within the democratic process. In Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape, such a structure could become increasingly significant, especially as monitoring and evaluating government policies grows more complex.\n\nThe debate has gained fresh momentum following recent announcements by Jamaat leader Shishir Monir and NCP leader Asif Mahmud, who have both expressed support for the idea of forming a shadow cabinet in the country.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairman Tarique Rahman is set to visit the residences of Dr. Shafiqur Rahman, ameer of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and Nahid Islam, convener of the National Citizens' Party (NCP), on Monday evening.\n\nThis visit has been widely hailed as a significant step toward fostering a new era of positive politics in the country.\n\nSarjis Alam, the chief coordinator of NCP’s northern region, expressed deep appreciation for Tarique Rahman’s initiative, which he views as a break from the tradition of political vengeance.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Sarjis wrote: “As a new beginning for positive politics, today (February 15) evening, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman will visit Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Dr. Shafiqur Rahman and the convener of National Citizens’ Party (NCP), Nahid Islam. This initiative transcends the old culture of political revenge and seeks to nurture mutual respect and harmony among political parties and leaders. Such efforts are essential for the democratic progress of Bangladesh. We sincerely thank Tarique Rahman for this timely step.”\n\nThe gesture comes at a time when the political atmosphere in Bangladesh has been marked by increasing polarization. Tarique Rahman’s visit is being seen as an attempt to bridge divides and encourage constructive dialogue among key political figures.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sarjis Alam had contested the 13th National Parliamentary Election in the Panchagarh-1 constituency, where he was defeated by BNP candidate Nawshad Jamir.\n\nThis development reflects a potential shift in the political dynamics of Bangladesh as leaders from different factions seek to collaborate for the nation’s democratic advancement.",

    "body": "This election opened a real path for democracy in Bangladesh and the energy was visible everywhere. From village tea stalls to city discussions, people talked about policy. They debated leadership and the future. Democracy felt active. It felt grounded in people’s daily lives.\n\nMany of us are glad to see elected leaders who speak about inclusion. But the final numbers brought disappointment. Only seven women were elected out of 300 parliamentary seats. This is a very small number and none of us can be fully satisfied with this outcome.\n\nThe gap feels sharp because women were highly visible throughout the election. They campaigned. They organized. They monitored polling. They voted in strong numbers. Their participation as citizens was high, yet their presence as elected representatives stayed low.\n\nThis mismatch should trouble anyone who believes in representative democracy.\n\nThis result is also a broken promise. The July Charter set a clear benchmark for this transition. It asked political parties to start with at least 5% women candidates in parliamentary nominations. This was meant to represent a political turning point.\n\nYet, women made up less than 4% of all candidates. Most major parties, including signatories to the charter, failed to meet even this modest 5% target. This was the charter’s first credibility test, and the political parties failed it.\n\nStill, disappointment can be a starting point. Today the number is seven. With planning, it can become 70 in the next election. This will not happen by chance. It will only happen if we keep reminding our institutions about this gap. We must stay committed to structural change.\n\nFrom the reform directions already in circulation, five concrete promises can directly support women’s leadership.\n\nFirst, we need direct elections for women’s reserved seats instead of indirect nomination. Earlier dialogues argued that direct elections give women real voter accountability. It gives them political legitimacy rather than just symbolic presence.\n\nSecond, we need a strict legal requirement for nominations. The voluntary commitments of the July Charter were ignored. We need mandatory rules requiring parties to nominate a minimum percentage of women. Without binding laws, parties often praise empowerment in manifestos but give very few winnable tickets.\n\nThird, we must expand reserved seats and link them to constituencies. Reform discussions have suggested linking women’s seats to defined geographic areas. This ensures representatives answer to voters, not only to party leadership.\n\nFourth, we need public campaign finance support. Research shows that lack of access to money is a strong barrier. Women often lack the property and informal funding networks that male candidates use to buy influence.\n\nFifth, we need constitutional backing for equal participation in oversight bodies. Many women MPs sit on committees but have limited influence. Rules should require proportional representation in key committees like finance, law, and public accounts.\n\nThe problem is not only national. It is global. Women’s equal participation is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet worldwide, women still hold only about 27% of parliamentary seats. Very few countries have reached parity. At the current pace, equal representation may take decades.\n\nEvidence shows that when women lead, outcomes improve. From local councils in South Asia to municipalities in Europe, women leaders have been linked with stronger delivery in water, childcare, and social protection.\n\nRepresentation is not only about fairness. It improves decisions.\n\nBangladesh’s own research explains why progress is slow. Patriarchal norms and male-dominated party structures hold women back. As noted during the recent election analysis, parties often treat financial viability as a prerequisite. This creates a cycle where men dominate because the system is designed around male access to resources.\n\nCan the government fix this alone? No. Government action is necessary, but not sufficient.\n\nPolitical parties must change how they finance and protect candidates. Their manifesto promises must be tracked. The media and civil society should publish gender scorecards after every election.\n\nCitizens also have power. We can question nomination lists. We can support capable women candidates openly. We can challenge social attitudes that treat politics as a male space. Change in numbers starts with change in culture.\n\nVoter turnout in this election was about 59.44%. That number can grow when people see that democracy truly includes everyone. A healthy democracy is measured not only by turnout. It is measured by who gets to lead.\n\nDemocracy grows through pressure. It grows through participation and accountability. The road is open. Now we have to walk it with purpose.\n\nFariha Hossain is a development professional and humanitarian. Her work focuses on social inclusion and women's rights in Bangladesh.

    "body": "The Washington Post has just fired one third of its journalists. We can, if we wish, look at this as a vile hollowing out of that essential counterparty to democracy, a free press. We can even -- as varied American politicians have been -- demand that as Jeff Bezos, the owner, is vastly rich then he should just keep swallowing the losses and stop complaining.\n\nIt's also possible to look at the underlying economics here and suggest that Bezos hasn't fired enough journalists.\n\nI know, this isn't something anyone else is saying, but then none of us who make our living in journalism like to see fewer of us being employed.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that the underlying economics does, over time, determine everything. American newspapers are a good example of this.\n\nBack in history, newspapers were monopolies. The sheer size of the country, the slowness of the transport system, meant that each really big city had its own paper. Which dominated its hinterland, as far as the lorries could get the one day's printing before it was time to turn around and get back for the next day's. The railway system is for freight, not passengers, so national distribution was impossible.\n\nAs local monopolies, the newspapers controlled the revenue from the classified ads, display ads and, of course, the revenues from people buying the paper itself.\n\nEach amounted to about one third of revenues and it was the classifieds that really made the profit. The sale of the newspaper itself really just covered the cost of printing and distributing it.\n\nThen the internet arrives. Facebook and Google make lesser inroads to display advertising. And of course no one is paying for the newspaper any more -- it's all online. The geographic monopolies have been broken because, well, geography doesn't matter on the internet.\n\nThe whole business has changed. Sure, there will still be big national newspapers. But they're not monopolies any more. So papers cannot be run on the basis of being monopolies, with huge numbers of unproductive staff just because they can be there. Competition is acting like it always does on former monopolies. Gutting them of the fat and inefficiency that monopoly allows.\n\nWhat is going to happen to the US newspaper industry is what has happened everywhere else that national competition has happened. Lean organizations -- like this one you're reading now, or like the UK newspaper industry from a century back when the railways were the national distribution system -- and only 10 or 12 of them too.\n\nInstead of a monopoly by area, there will be those many fewer competing with each other. The competition demands both the many fewer and the greater efficiency of those that remain.\n\nNow, we can say that this is not desirable. We can insist that we'd prefer it some other way. But because the underlying economics was as it was, is now as it is, that's the way it's going to be.\n\nI've written for the Washington Post, someone I used to work with has just been hired as a columnist there, someone I greatly admire and have copied has been a columnist there for some years. I even used to read the paper religiously when I lived in Washington DC.\n\nBut none of those change the basic and important point here. The economics underlying American newspapers have changed. Therefore American newspapers have to change.\n\nThis also isn't a point just about newspapers. When the underlying economics changes, then every organisation that was formerly sitting atop them then those organizations have to change too. American newspapers are merely an example of this.\n\nTim Worstall is a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London.",

    "title": "The architecture of power",
    "body": "In the autumn of 1990, a mass uprising forced the resignation of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Power shifted because public legitimacy evaporated. Yet what followed was not institutional rebirth. It was the restoration of party dominance under familiar banners. Bangladesh moved from one concentration of authority to another, as if history were less a system learning to regulate itself and more a pendulum swinging between personalities.\n\nFor three decades thereafter, electoral victories translated into executive centralization. Party leadership and state leadership fused in one person. The party chair became the gravitational centre of governance. Cabinet, parliament, and bureaucracy revolved around that core. When the leader appeared strong, the state seemed stable. When the leader weakened, the structure trembled.\n\nThe rivalry between the Awami League under Sheikh Hasina and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party under the Zia family entrenched this architecture. Both camps conflated symbolic authority with executive control. Victory meant command over institutions. Defeat meant marginalization bordering on erasure.\n\nThe result was boycotts, confrontations, politicized administration, and institutional fatigue. Economic planning suffered. Regulatory independence eroded. Democratic credibility thinned.\n\nThe 2026 election has rewritten the immediate balance of power. The BNP has secured a decisive parliamentary majority and now commands the next government. The mandate reflects public appetite for change after economic strain and prolonged political concentration.\n\nYet electoral triumph does not answer the structural question Bangladesh has long avoided. Not merely who governs, but how governance should be organised.\n\nTarique Rahman’s centrality to the BNP’s revival is indisputable. During years of repression and exile, he preserved organizational coherence and helped engineer the party’s return. The victory is inseparable from that continuity. Removing him from party leadership would be neither realistic nor strategically wise.\n\nThe deeper question is whether party leadership must automatically convert into executive government leadership. Bangladesh’s history counsels caution. When the same individual embodies the ideological centre of a party and the administrative head of the state, dissent narrows. Cabinet autonomy contracts. Policy risks becoming an extension of personality. Institutional criticism is recast as personal disloyalty. Accountability weakens.\n\nComparative politics suggests alternatives. In the United Kingdom, four prime ministers served between 2016 and 2022 under the same majority party without systemic collapse. Party continuity coexisted with executive turnover.\n\nGermany formalized role differentiation: A largely ceremonial Federal President and an executive Federal Chancellor. Stability rests on structure rather than permanence of one individual.\n\nJapan’s postwar history reveals decades of single-party dominance with frequent changes in prime ministers. Party durability absorbed internal pressures while executive leadership rotated.\n\nBangladesh is distinct in history and political culture. Yet the structural lesson is portable. Systems that distinguish symbolic authority from executive responsibility are more adaptable. They reduce political temperature and create space for correction without rupture.\n\nApplied to the present moment, this logic suggests a disciplined course. Retain Tarique Rahman as the strategic nucleus of the party, responsible for ideological direction, organizational renewal, and long-term political strategy. At the same time, nominate a prime minister distinct from him, someone whose legitimacy is anchored in administrative competence and institutional performance.\n\nThis does not diminish his influence. It elevates it. As strategic architect rather than daily administrator, he would shape the party’s horizon without absorbing the frictions of executive management. The prime minister would govern within constitutional parameters, accountable to parliament and law, not to informal personal hierarchy.\n\nSuch differentiation would signal maturation beyond personality fusion. It would reassure domestic constituencies and international partners that governance will be institutional rather than personalised. For an electorate fatigued by concentration and confrontation, it would indicate seriousness about competence and stability.\n\nThe economic implications are substantial. Bangladesh’s development model depends on export manufacturing, remittances, and macroeconomic stability. Investors assess predictability. Credit evaluations incorporate governance risk. When authority is heavily personalized, policy direction appears contingent on individual survival. Risk premiums rise. Separating party leadership from executive authority introduces institutional reassurance. It signals that policy frameworks are process driven rather than personality dependent.\n\nAdministrative benefits follow. A prime minister distinct from the party chair must build authority through cabinet coordination, parliamentary engagement, and bureaucratic management. That necessity strengthens collective decision-making and clarifies accountability. It reduces the likelihood of parallel informal power centres that distort governance.\n\nSceptics will warn that such separation could be cosmetic, with real power exercised elsewhere. That danger is genuine. The model succeeds only if role differentiation is operational and transparent. Empowered institutions, clear chains of responsibility, and visible decision-making processes are essential. Without them, separation becomes theatre.\n\nYet replicating the old fusion model carries heavier risks. Concentrated authority invites concentrated opposition. Governance becomes synonymous with loyalty to one individual. Institutional reform stalls because reform unsettles entrenched networks. Bangladesh has seen the costs of that design.\n\nThe electorate today is younger, more connected, and less deferential than in the 1990s. Urbanization and an expanding middle class have altered expectations. Citizens increasingly demand pragmatic solutions over symbolic dominance. A leadership model that distributes authority aligns more closely with these realities.\n\nThere is also a geopolitical dimension. Bangladesh navigates complex relationships with regional powers while remaining integrated into global trade networks. Strategic autonomy requires calibrated diplomacy.\n\nAn executive leader with technocratic credibility can manage external engagement without every move being filtered through domestic personality narratives. Meanwhile, the party chair can maintain strategic coherence at home.\n\nNone of this diminishes Tarique Rahman’s importance. It reframes it. By remaining the strategic nucleus rather than assuming the executive helm, he positions himself as builder of durable structures rather than occupant of a transient office. The prime minister would run the state within institutional constraints, strengthening the distinction between party and government.\n\nPolitical maturity is measured not by how tightly power is held, but by how intelligently it is structured. Having won decisively, the BNP now has an opportunity rarely granted in Bangladeshi politics: To redesign authority at the moment of triumph rather than under duress.\n\nSystems built around individuals can rise quickly and fracture abruptly. Systems built around differentiated roles move more deliberately and endure. The choice before the new government is not between strength and weakness, but between fusion and structure. Power fused commands attention. Power structured commands longevity.\n\nMahbubur Rahman is a strategic communications expert with nearly two decades of experience working across governance reform, public systems, and development programming focused on the intersection of political institutions, economic resilience, and long-term structural reform.

    "body": "BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman has pledged to implement, in phases, every commitment made to the people.\n\nHe made the remarks at a press conference held at 3:30pm on Saturday at the ballroom of Hotel InterContinental, in the presence of local and foreign journalists.\n\nIn the 13th National Parliamentary Election held on February 12, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured 208 out of 297 seats, achieving an absolute majority and returning to power after two decades. Tarique Rahman is set to become prime minister for the first time after being elected as a member of parliament.\n\nFollowing the victory, he faced the media at the press conference, which opened with remarks by BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and concluded with a statement by Standing Committee Member and Election Management Committee Chairman Nazrul Islam Khan.\n\nTarique Rahman said the BNP had formulated its 31-point reform outline through consultations with people across the country as a democratic party. The party manifesto was based on that 31-point agenda.\n\nHe added that BNP had also signed the July Charter, mentioning a “note of dissent” on several issues.\n\n“We will implement, step by step, every expected commitment we have made to the people,” he said.\n\nReferring to the party’s renewed mandate, he said the people had once again entrusted the BNP, founded by the proclaimer of independence, with the responsibility of running the state. “The people have shown their trust and love for BNP. We must now work in unity and with dedication to improve their standard of living and repay that trust,” he added.\n\nHe described the victory as belonging to the country and to democracy. “This is a victory for Bangladesh, for democracy, and for the people who cherish democracy. From today, we are all free. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the country. Despite many obstacles, we have paved the way for the restoration of democracy,” he said.\n\nCalling on party leaders and activists to remain calm and vigilant, he urged restraint to prevent any untoward incidents in the post-election period. “Even in the face of provocation, I am asking leaders and activists across the country to stay peaceful and cautious,” he said.\n\nHe noted that despite the landslide victory, he had instructed party members and alliance partners not to hold victory processions to avoid any instability. “We celebrated our victory by offering prayers of gratitude,” he said.\n\nEmphasizing the need to maintain peace and order, the BNP chief said restoring law and order would be a top priority. “No form of violence, retaliation or provocative activity will be tolerated. My position is clear: peace and order must be maintained at any cost,” he stated.\n\nHe stressed that justice would be the guiding principle of his government. “Without establishing the rule of law, all efforts will fail. The law will be equal for every citizen, whether from the ruling party, the opposition, or holding a different opinion. The application of law will follow due process,” he said.\n\nOn foreign policy, in response to a question about relations with India, he said Bangladesh’s foreign policy would be determined by safeguarding the broader interests of the country and its people.\n\nAsked about the key challenges he expects to face as head of government, he cited the economy and law and order as major concerns. “We must ensure the security of the people. The previous government politicized almost all institutions. We must ensure good governance,” he said.\n\nRegarding whether BNP would seek the extradition of Sheikh Hasina from India, he said the matter would depend on legal procedures. On China, he described the country as a long-standing development partner and expressed hope for continued cooperation.\n\nKhaled Mohiuddin, journalist from New York-based media outlet Thikana. asked how difficult the election had been for BNP and whether any “engineering” was involved in securing victory. Tarique Rahman replied that the real challenge was convincing the people and ensuring a fair and conducive environment. “Any worthwhile goal requires effort,” he said.\n\nResponding to a question from The Independent in the UK about balancing relations with India, Pakistan and China, Standing Committee Member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said BNP’s foreign policy would apply equally to all countries and would not revolve around any single state.\n\nAt the end of the press conference, Tarique Rahman and Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir flashed the victory sign. Earlier, Rahman entered the ballroom wearing a white shirt and was greeted with applause from party leaders. He raised his hand in greeting to journalists upon arrival.\n\nAmong others present at the press conference were Standing Committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Abdul Moyeen Khan, Nazrul Islam Khan, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, Salahuddin Ahmed, Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, Selima Rahman, Hafiz Uddin Ahmed and AZM Zahid Hossain.",

    "body": "After securing a sweeping majority in the 13th National Parliamentary Election, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party is preparing to form the new government. The government has already published the official gazette listing the elected members of parliament.\n\nAccording to Article 148 of the Constitution, elected representatives must take oath within three days of the publication of the official results. The elected members of the 13th National Parliamentary Election will take their oaths on Tuesday, and the cabinet will also take their oaths later that day. Election Commission Secretary Akhtar Ahmed confirmed the schedule at a press briefing on Saturday.\n\nParty sources say Tarique Rahman is set to assume office as Prime Minister after the government is formed. Alongside experienced politicians, the party plans to assign key responsibilities to younger and highly educated leaders. A blend of senior and new leadership is expected in important ministries such as Home Affairs, Law, Finance, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nSeveral BNP policymakers have indicated that the cabinet will not be overly large. It is expected to consist of between 32 and 42 members. BNP Chairperson Tarique Rahman has already begun consultations with senior leaders regarding the formation of the cabinet. However, the allocation of specific ministries will be known only after the oath ceremony.\n\nBNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed said the nation will need to wait a little longer to see the final shape of the cabinet.\n\nFor the post of Foreign Minister, BNP Joint Secretary General Humayun Kabir is being discussed, given his active role in strengthening the party’s international relations. Dr Reza Kibria is being considered for the position of Finance Minister. He previously served as a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAmir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury is being considered for the Commerce Ministry, a position he held in the past. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir is being discussed for the Local Government Ministry. He previously served as State Minister for Agriculture and later for Civil Aviation and Tourism.\n\nFormer Attorney General and senior Supreme Court lawyer Md Asaduzzaman is being mentioned for the Law Ministry. Salahuddin Ahmed is also in discussion for the Home Ministry, while Mirza Abbas is being considered for the Road Transport and Bridges Ministry.\n\nDr AZM Zahid Hossain is likely to take charge of the Health Ministry, and Ruhul Kabir Rizvi is being discussed for the Information Ministry. Other names reportedly under consideration include Nazrul Islam Khan, Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Major (Retd.) Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, Selima Rahman, Andaleeve Rahman Partho, Mizanur Rahman Minu and Shama Obayed, among others.\n\nThere is also speculation that the presidency may see a change after the new government is formed. Senior Standing Committee member Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain is being discussed for the post. However, if Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir is nominated for president, a major reshuffle in the cabinet could follow.\n\nOther figures being discussed include Ashrafuddin Nizam, Zonayed Saki, Ishraq Hossain, Abdul Awal Mintoo, Andaleeve Rahman Partho, Nitai Roy Chowdhury, Kazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad, Shahid Uddin Chowdhury Anee, Anindya Islam Amit, Khandaker Abdul Muktadir, Ariful Haque Chowdhury, Osman Faruque, Bobby Hajjaj, Hummam Quader Chowdhury, Nayab Yusuf, Zahir Uddin Swapan, Barrister Farzana Sharmeen Putul, Nurul Haq Nur, Naoshad Zamir, Mir Helal, Asadul Habib Dulu, Ali Asghar Lobby, Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu, and Md Shariful Alam.\n\nUltimately, the final composition of the cabinet will depend on the decision of the party’s Standing Committee and Chairperson Tarique Rahman. As Prime Minister, he may revise the final list at any time, according to party insiders.\n\nPreparations at Bangabhaban\n\nThe newly elected MPs will be sworn in Tuesday morning by Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, while President Md Sahabuddin will administer the oath to the cabinet members in the afternoon.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the President will appoint as Prime Minister the parliamentary leader of the party that secures a majority in the National Parliament. As per convention, after the elected members are sworn in at the Parliament Secretariat, both the ruling party and the opposition will hold separate meetings to elect their parliamentary leaders.\n\nThe elected parliamentary leader of the majority party or alliance will then pay a courtesy call on the President at Bangabhaban. During that meeting, the President will formally invite the leader to form the government.\n\nFollowing this invitation, the Prime Minister-designate will submit the names of ministers, state ministers, and deputy ministers to the President. The President will immediately forward the list to the Cabinet Division, which will complete preparations for the oath ceremony at the earliest possible time.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary will personally call each designated cabinet member, inviting them to attend the oath ceremony at Bangabhaban. Official vehicles will also be sent to their residences.\n\nSources said the Cabinet Division has already collected the names and personal phone numbers of the newly elected MPs. New folders and flags have been procured for the oath ceremony, and official vehicles have been made ready for the incoming cabinet members.",

    "body": "BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman on Monday said convincing people to get two-thirds majority in the national election was their ‘engineering’ and no other manipulative tactics.\n\n“Convincing the people of the country and bringing them over to our side was our engineering. Alhamdulillah, we have succeeded in it,” he said.\n\nTarique made the remarks during a post-election press conference at a city hotel in response to a journalist’s question about whether he resorted to election engineering to win more than 200 seats.\n\nResponding to a question from an Indian journalist about the foreign policy of a future BNP government and mending relations with India, Tarique said, “We have made it clear that the foreign policy will prioritise the interests of Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi people. Protecting Bangladesh’s interests will guide our decisions.”\n\nBNP Standing Committee member Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury elaborated, saying Bangladesh’s foreign policy follows the principle of multilateralism. “We don’t have any country-centric policy. Our approach applies to all countries based on mutual respect, mutual interest, non-interference, and strategic autonomy for Bangladesh. These are the fundamentals of our foreign policy.”\n\nAnswering a question on whether the BNP government would review the verdict against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by the International Crimes Tribunal, Khosru said this is a matter for the judiciary. “We believe the judiciary should remain separate from the executive and legislative branches.”\n\nRegarding relations with India, Pakistan, and China, Khosru reiterated that BNP’s foreign policy treats all countries equally and is not country-centric.\n\nOn the key challenges his government might face, Tarique said tackling the economy will be a top priority. “We also face the challenge of ensuring law and order and guaranteeing safety for the people.”\n\nHe criticised the previous authoritarian regime for politicising nearly all institutions, adding that ensuring good governance will be a major task for his government.\n\nOn future relations with China, Tarique said, “We will protect the interests of Bangladesh and its people. If a measure is not in Bangladesh’s interest, we cannot support it. China, like many others, is a development partner, and we hope both countries can continue to work together.”\n\nResponding to a question on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), he said his government would review it first and decide only if it benefits Bangladesh’s economy.\n\nOn listening to youths’ voices in governance, Tarique said, “We will definitely listen to the youth, but we also need to address the issues of all people in society.”\n\nRegarding reactivating SAARC, he said, “This forum was initiated by Bangladesh. Naturally, we would want to revive it. Once the government is settled, we will discuss with our friends and try to revive it.”\n\nIn response to another question about brining Sheikh Hasina back from India, he said, “That depends on the legal process.”\n\nOn tackling inflation, Tarique said, “Our focus will be on bringing in more businesses and creating jobs.”\n\nFinally, when asked about reconciliation with Awami League supporters who are staying in the country, he said it would be addressed by ensuring the rule of law.",

    "body": "Mamunul Haque, ameer of Bangladesh Khelafat Majlis and a candidate of the 11-party alliance, has alleged “engineering” during vote counting in the Dhaka-13 constituency.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday after submitting a complaint at the Election Commission building in Agargaon, Mamunul said it was impossible to prevent the alleged manipulation.\n\n“This time the election was free from violence. There were a large turnout and great enthusiasm among voters. The polling period was relatively peaceful. However, the ‘engineering’ that took place during counting could not be stopped. It was carried out in a very planned manner. The matter is clear to us,” he said.\n\nHe added: “Throughout the day a transparent and calm environment was shown. But during the counting, what was intended was carried out. As a result, the true reflection of public opinion has not emerged through this election.”\n\nMamunul claimed that in many polling stations, result sheets were not signed by his polling agents. He alleged that his agents were removed from several centers, and in some cases, signatures had been taken in advance through various means. He also said many result sheets showed signs of alteration, including erasures, tampering, and overwriting.\n\n“It is clear that one figure was written earlier and later replaced with another. In every case, the alterations appear to have been made in favor of a particular candidate. This clearly indicates an attempt to inflate votes for that specific symbol,” he said.\n\nHe also alleged irregularities with ballot papers in Dhaka-13, claiming that the final row of the second section was left blank, causing confusion among voters. “Many people assumed the blank space was allocated to the last candidate listed in the first section, as there was only a small dividing line in between. Many voters mistakenly stamped the blank space,” he said.\n\nAccording to Haque, 4,381 votes were invalidated in this way. He further alleged that similar ballot papers were used in other constituencies, but those votes were not declared invalid. “Why, then, were our votes canceled? This is our main complaint,” he added.\n\nWhen asked why no complaint was lodged at the centers during counting, Haque said many of his polling agents were unable to speak out and that he and his representatives were denied proper access to certain centers. He claimed he was barred from entering Residential Model College after 4:30pm, despite having information about alleged irregularities there.\n\nClaiming that he did not receive a level playing field, Haque said the 11-party alliance was unable to raise objections at the centers and therefore submitted their complaint to the Election Commission. “We have now formally lodged our complaint. We intend to continue this fight until the very end,” he added.",

Nevertheless, the EU mission recommended further reforms to enhance legal certainty and close loopholes that could undermine institutional accountability and transparency.\n\nIjabs said the newly appointed EC had taken a proactive approach to rebuilding public trust. He also acknowledged support from the interim government and other stakeholders, noting that the commission responded promptly to media queries, shared public-interest information, and maintained dialogue with political parties.\n\nDespite these positive assessments, the mission expressed concern over the marginal participation of women candidates.\n\n“Unfortunately, women were largely absent from this election,” Ijabs said. Only 4% of the total candidates were women. The BNP fielded 10 female candidates and the NCP two, while Jamaat-e-Islami and 30 other parties nominated none.\n\nThe chief observer said this reflected a lack of political will to advance women in national politics, despite commitments made in the July Charter. He also cited structural barriers including patriarchy, discrimination, and instances of digital and physical harassment.\n\nThe EU mission further noted that indigenous communities and religious minorities expressed disappointment over the absence of special measures to ensure their political representation.\n\nObservers also raised concerns about growing religious undertones in public discourse, including online spaces, and reported a tangible fear of physical violence.\n\nWhile acknowledging a spike in scattered political violence in early February, the mission said the incidents remained localized and showed no systematic pattern.\n\nThe EU EOM documented around 56 incidents of physical violence across 27 districts, resulting in at least 200 casualties. The interim government also reported five deaths linked to political activities since the election announcement.\n\nThe EU observers will remain in Bangladesh to continue monitoring post-election developments and are expected to publish a final report with detailed recommendations in the coming months.",

According to him, these incidents are not isolated but appear to be organized displays of power aimed at establishing political dominance.\n\nNahid said: “The politics of occupying the field through post-election violence will not succeed. Those using the public’s mandate as a shield to instill fear are siding with history’s wrong path. Political survival is ensured not by suppressing competition but through fair and just rivalry.”\n\nHe called for an immediate cessation of violence, enforcement of the rule of law, and strengthening of democracy based on public trust and participation. “All acts of violence must stop immediately, and the perpetrators should be arrested and brought under the law. The safety of those affected must be ensured.”\n\nNahid warned that administrative silence, negligence, or bias could deepen the crisis and raise questions about the state’s impartiality. He further cautioned that any attempts to impose new terror and domination in post-24 February Bangladesh would be met with firm responses from students and citizens through democratic means.",

We encourage them to be magnanimous and united in their shared democratic future,” said the former President of Ghana while presenting the Group’s interim statement on Thursday’s national election and referendum at a city hotel.\n\nLooking ahead to the next election cycle, he encouraged the Bangladesh Election Commission to conduct a post-election review, including consideration of all observer recommendations, in line with international good practice.\n\nThe final report, detailing the Group’s full findings and recommendations, will be submitted to the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Shirley Botchwey, before being shared with the government of Bangladesh, the Election Commission, political parties, and Commonwealth governments, and then made public.\n\nThe Chairperson acknowledged the context in which the elections were held, including significant political developments following the July Uprising of 2024, as well as decisions affecting the participation of some political parties.\n\nWhile noting isolated reports of post-election tensions, the Group encouraged all stakeholders to promote calm and peaceful conduct during the post-election period and to resolve disputes through appropriate legal channels.\n\nThe Observer Group praised vibrant media coverage, noting its important role in informing citizens and encouraging political debate.\n\nAt the same time, it raised concerns about online misinformation, cyber harassment, and hate speech, which continue to affect public discourse.\n\nThe participation of women and youth emerged as areas requiring greater attention. Women accounted for only 4 percent of candidates, with seven elected, while youth activism did not always translate into formal influence within political party structures, he said.\n\nAccording to the statement, despite isolated pre- and post-election tensions, polling officials, security personnel, and election agents generally carried out their duties with professionalism.\n\nThe Group also noted that officials assisted elderly voters and persons with disabilities. However, many polling stations remained inaccessible, particularly those located on upper floors, and lacked provisions for other forms of disability.\n\nOn the referendum, the Group said it recognizes the Charter as a response to multiple urgent demands for reform. “At the same time, some stakeholders expressed concerns as to whether the referendum process was sufficiently consultative and clearly communicated.”\n\nThe Commonwealth Observer Group is an independent body that makes recommendations to the Commonwealth Secretary-General. It was constituted by the Secretary-General and comprised 12 experts drawn from the fields of politics, law, media, gender, and election administration from several Commonwealth regions.\n\nBangladesh was admitted as the Commonwealth’s 34th member on April 18, 1972, following its independence in December 1971.\n\nThis marks the fourth deployment of a Commonwealth Observer Group to Bangladesh.",

Our economy faces challenges, and the country’s law and order situation is a concern. We must ensure the security of the people. The previous government politicized almost all institutions. Therefore, we must ensure good governance.”\n\nOn Bangladesh’s future relations with China and the Belt and Road Initiative, Tarique said: “We will try to protect the interests of the people of Bangladesh. If something is not in Bangladesh’s interest, naturally we cannot pursue it. I am certain that mutual interests will be our first priority.”\n\nRegarding the Belt and Road Initiative, he added: “If it benefits Bangladesh and supports the economy, we will make a decision.” When asked whether he would consult with youth in decision-making, Tarique said, “People have supported us, and we will certainly listen to the youth. But there are more people in this society. Everyone has some issue or the other; we have to listen to everyone.”\n\nOn reviving SAARC, Tarique said: “You know, SAARC was established through Bangladesh’s initiative. We want it to function. We will discuss with our friendly states and try to revive SAARC.”\n\nAsked whether BNP would seek the extradition of Sheikh Hasina from India, he said: “That depends on the legal process.” Responding to another question on China, Tarique said: “They have been Bangladesh’s long-term development partners. We hope to create areas where we can work together.”\n\nOn plans to address a fragile economy, low investment, and inflation, the BNP chairman said: “We will bring in new investments and create employment.”",

    "body": "Dubai’s DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.\n\nThe statement did not mention bin Sulayem. But his close ties to Jeffrey Epstein were revealed in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, where he is cited more than 9,400 times -- making international headlines and sparking condemnations.\n\n“DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as Chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer,” the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.\n\nDP World took down bin Sulayem’s biography from their website shortly after the statement came out.\n\nDescribed by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends.” bin Sulayem was group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the largest port operators on the globe.\n\nThe move to replace him followed a decision on Wednesday by British government investment institution BII to suspend investments with DP World in view of the revelations.\n\n“We are shocked by the facts emerging in the Epstein files regarding Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company,” a spokesperson said.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson said: “We welcome today’s decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership.”\n\nBII is an investor with DP World in four ports in Africa.\n\nThe Canadian firm La Caisse had also suspended ties with DP World earlier this week but on Friday said it was resuming its partnership following bin Sulayem’s replacement.\n\n“The company has taken the necessary measures. We will quickly get to work with DP World’s new leadership to continue our partnership in port projects around the world,” the Canadian pension fund told AFP.\n\nThe documents revealed that Epstein and bin Sulayem maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on intimate matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.\n\nThe mere mention of someone’s name in the Epstein files does not in itself imply any wrongdoing by that person.\n\nThe wealthy Emirati businessman was presented by Epstein as “the right hand” of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\n\nThe correspondence suggests bin Sulayem visited the US sex offender at his home several times, including on his island.\n\nHe also shared very intimate information with Epstein.\n\nHe told him details about his relationship with a student at a Dubai university, with whom he described having the “best sex I ever had amazing body,” and reported sexual massages he received during a trip to Tokyo.\n\nTheir correspondence shows that bin Sulayem travelled to Israel several years before the United Arab Emirates normalized ties with the country, and that Epstein put him in contact with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, who along with Representative Ro Khanna had access to unredacted versions of the files, posted on X a 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video.”\n\nKhanna then took to the House floor and read the names of six men whose names he said had been redacted, including bin Sulayem’s.\n\nMassie on Friday posted a tweet referencing bin Sulayem’s resignation and said: “DOJ redacted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the ‘torture video email.’ @RepRoKhanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns.”\n\nEpstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor. His extensive ties to the world’s rich and powerful, especially after he was released in 2009, have become politically explosive across the globe.\n\nHe died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide.",

    "body": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to “revitalize” the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global “renewal.”\n\nSpeaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump’s vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington’s allies, Washington’s top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.\n\n“We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” Rubio said. “What we want is a reinvigorated alliance.”\n\n“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US “belong together.”\n\nThe United States will be “driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilization’s past,” he said.\n\n“It is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe,” he said.\n\nHe echoed Trump administration’s oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that “mass migration” was “a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West.”\n\n“We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization and together with us are willing and able to defend it.”\n\n“Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”\n\nRubio’s speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.\n\nAside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a “rift” between US and Europe.\n\nUS-Europe ties were further strained by the new US National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with “civilizational decline.”\n\nTies plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Nato member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.\n\nEuropean leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared Nato defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gather on Saturday that “Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility” for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying “10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever.”\n\nBritish leader Keir Starmer said “We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age.”\n\n“We must be able to deter aggression and, yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight,” he said calling for a building of “a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defense production.”\n\nOn Friday Nato chief Mark Rutte said that “a strong Europe in a strong Nato means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever” and French President Emmanuel Macron said that “this is the right time for a strong Europe,” that would be “building its own architecture of security.”\n\nThe high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defense and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth grueling year.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.\n\nAt the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move,” the US leader said.\n\nBut Rubio said that “We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war.”\n\nMacron said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.\n\nAnd Merz said that “If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” but charged that “Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously.”\n\nRubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.",

    "body": "The United States military is preparing for the possibility of weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders military action, according to two US officials, raising concerns of a more serious conflict between the longtime rivals.\n\nThe officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said planning is underway for a sustained campaign that could target Iranian state and security facilities beyond nuclear infrastructure. Such operations would carry greater risks for US forces and could trigger wider instability across the Middle East, reports Reuters.\n\nDiplomatic efforts are continuing alongside the military preparations. US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week aimed at reviving negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program. However, Trump said reaching a deal has been “difficult,” warning that the alternative to diplomacy could be “very traumatic.”\n\nThe Pentagon has recently deployed additional military assets to the region, including an aircraft carrier, fighter jets, guided-missile destroyers and thousands of troops to strengthen offensive and defensive capabilities, reports UNB.\n\nUS officials said Washington fully expects Iran to retaliate if strikes occur, potentially leading to prolonged exchanges of attacks. Experts warn that Iran’s large missile arsenal could threaten US forces and bases across the region.\n\nThe White House said Trump is considering all options regarding Iran but will make a final decision based on US national security interests. The Pentagon declined to comment on the operational planning.\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has warned that any strike on Iranian territory would be met with retaliation against US bases in the Middle East, including those in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTehran says it is open to negotiations on limits to its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, but it has ruled out linking the talks to its missile program.",

    "title": "IRI: Mostly peaceful election signals progress for Bangladesh",
    "body": "The International Republican Institute (IRI) has described Bangladesh’s 2026 parliamentary election as an important step forward for the country’s democracy, while urging continued reforms to strengthen political inclusion and stability.\n\nIn a preliminary statement released on Saturday, IRI said it deployed a delegation of international observers to Dhaka from Monday to Friday to assess the 12 February national election.\n\nThe delegation was led by former United States Congressman David Dreier. During their visit, the team met with the Bangladesh Election Commission, political parties, interim government officials and civil society representatives to evaluate the overall electoral environment.\n\nDreier said security forces and the Election Commission performed admirably and that Election Day was mostly peaceful and incident-free.\n\n“After years of authoritarian rule, Election Day was mostly peaceful. Given the historical context, that is a big step forward for Bangladesh,” he said.\n\nHe added that the new government should now focus on implementing the July Charter reforms and ensuring that state institutions work effectively for all citizens.\n\nAccording to IRI, the pre-election period was relatively peaceful compared to previous elections, although clashes between supporters of rival political parties occurred in several districts. Hundreds of violent incidents were reported nationwide before voting, but these appeared to be localized and not centrally coordinated.\n\nThe political environment remained polarized. Observers noted some local-level remarks about pluralism, women’s participation and minority representation, which created uncertainty among stakeholders about commitments to inclusive politics.\n\nIRI reported that voter turnout reached 59%, which is significantly higher than the previous parliamentary election. The reform allowing citizens who turned 18 on or before Election Day to vote helped expand participation.\n\nMany first-time voters, especially young people under 35, took part in the election. However, IRI noted ongoing concerns about the historical undercounting of women on the voter roll.\n\nThe mission praised the Bangladesh Election Commission for strong logistical preparation and professional management of a complex national operation. It said the Commission showed greater transparency compared to past elections.\n\nKey reforms welcomed by IRI included:\n\nIntroduction of postal voting for Bangladeshis living abroad\n\nClearer accreditation rules for citizen observers\n\nA nationwide voter education campaign\n\nHowever, the delegation said that the three-day observation period allowed for citizen observers was too short for a full review of the election process. It recommended extending observation time to cover the entire electoral cycle, including dispute resolution and final certification of results.\n\nIRI expressed concern over the underrepresentation of women and ethnic and religious minorities among candidates. While no widespread targeting of minority communities was observed on Election Day, localized tensions indicated possible vulnerability.\n\nThe report also noted that one of the country’s largest political parties did not contest the election, which limited the range of political choices available to voters. IRI said continued dialogue among stakeholders is needed to ensure broader political representation in the future.\n\nVoting generally began on time, with essential materials in place and presiding officers acting professionally. Polling stations were mostly orderly and calm. Counting and tabulation were conducted transparently and efficiently.\n\nHowever, some polling centres were located on upper floors without ramps or proper access, creating difficulties for elderly voters and persons with disabilities.\n\nObservers also noted limited partisan activity near some polling station entrances, which could create perceptions of unequal campaign conditions, though it did not significantly disrupt voting.\n\nSecurity was tight nationwide, with police, army, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion and other forces deployed across the country. Although there were isolated clashes and two crude bomb blasts in Gopalganj and Munshiganj that temporarily disrupted polling, voting later resumed. Overall violence remained limited.\n\nIRI said it will continue monitoring the post-election period and will publish a final comprehensive report with detailed analysis and recommendations to improve future elections.\n\nThe organization, which has supported more than 270 election observation missions worldwide, said the 2026 election represents a meaningful opportunity for democratic renewal in Bangladesh,provided that reforms continue and political actors work together to strengthen inclusive governance.",

    "body": "Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy said Friday she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders’s comments that cinema should “stay out of politics” when asked about Gaza.\n\nRoy said in a statement sent to AFP that she was “shocked and disgusted” by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference on Thursday.\n\nRoy, whose novel “The God of Small Things” won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones,” in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.\n\nHowever, she said that the “unconscionable” statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, “with deep regret.”\n\nWhen asked about Germany’s support for Israel at a press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: “We cannot really enter the field of politics,” describing filmmakers as “the counterweight to politics.”\n\nFellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a “little bit unfair” to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.\n\nRoy said in her statement that “to hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping.”\n\nShe described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel.”\n\n“If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them,” she said.\n\nRoy is one of India’s most famous living authors and is a trenchant critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, as well as a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause.\n\nRestored versions of two films by late Egyptian directors, “Sad Song of Touha” by Atteyat Al Abnoudy and “The Dislocation of Amber” by Hussein Shariffe, have also been withdrawn from the festival over its stance on Gaza.\n\n“The Berlinale respects these decisions,” a spokeswoman said in a statement sent to AFP.\n\n“We regret that we will not welcome them as their presence would have enriched the festival discourse,” she said.\n\nThe Berlinale traditionally has a reputation for topical, progressive programming, but so far this year’s edition has seen several stars shy away from taking a stance on the big political issues of the day.\n\nUS actor Neil Patrick Harris, who stars in the film “Sunny Dancer” was asked on Friday if he considered his art to be political and if it could help “fight the rise of fascism.”\n\nHe replied that he was “interested in doing things that are apolitical” and which could help people find connection in our “strangely algorithmic and divided world.”\n\nThis year’s Honorary Golden Bear recipient, Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh, also demurred when asked to comment on US politics in a press conference on Friday, saying she “cannot presume to say I understand” the situation there.\n\nThis is not the first edition of the festival to run into controversy over the Gaza war.\n\nIn 2024, the festival’s documentary award went to “No Other Land,” which follows the dispossession of Palestinian communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nGerman government officials criticized “one-sided” remarks about Gaza by the directors of that film and others at that year’s awards ceremony.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen,” as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.\n\nTrump’s comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran’s clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington’s arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear program.\n\nAt the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution, renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.\n\n“Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted “regime change” in Iran.\n\nTrump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that “there are people.”\n\nHe has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.\n\nSpeaking earlier at the White House, Trump said that the USS Gerald R. Ford -- the world’s largest warship -- would be “leaving very soon” for the Middle East to up the pressure on Iran.\n\n“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Trump said.\n\nThe giant vessel is currently in the Caribbean following the US overthrow of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. Another carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is one of 12 US ships already in the Middle East.\n\nWhen Iran began its crackdown on protests last month -- which rights groups say killed thousands -- Trump initially said that the United States was “locked and loaded” to help demonstrators.\n\nBut he has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear program, which US forces struck last July during Israel’s unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.\n\nThe protests have subsided for now but US-based Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, urged international intervention to support the Iranian people.\n\n“We are asking for a humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process,” he told the Munich Security Conference.\n\nIt followed a call by the opposition leader, who has not returned to his country since before the revolution, for Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations this weekend.\n\nVideos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.\n\nIran and the United States, who have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the revolution, held talks on the nuclear issue last week in Oman. No dates have been set for new talks yet.\n\nThe West fears the program is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.\n\nThe head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities was possible but “terribly difficult.”\n\nTrump said after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that he wanted to continue talks with Iran, defying pressure from his key ally for a tougher stance.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister himself expressed skepticism at the quality of any agreement if it didn’t also cover Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.\n\nAccording to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 7,008 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the recent crackdown, although rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.\n\nMore than 53,000 people have also been arrested, it added.\n\nThe Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) NGO said “hundreds” of people were facing charges linked to the protests that could see them sentenced to death.\n\nFigures working within the Iranian system have also been arrested, with three politicians detained this week from the so-called reformist wing of Iranian politics supportive of President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThe three -- Azar Mansouri, Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh -- were released on bail Thursday and Friday, their lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the Isna news agency.",

He was the son of Shahjahan Sardar of Par Nawapara village in Bagerhat Sadar upazila.\n\nThe clash occurred on February 13 in Chhitabari village under Dhopakhali union of Kachua upazila between the supporters of the BNP’s “Sheaf of Paddy” symbol and those backing an independent “rebel” candidate. At least 10 people from both sides, including Osman, were injured in the violence.\n\nAccording to the victim’s elder brother, Enamul Kabir Sardar, a group of supporters of the Sheaf of Paddy symbol had been searching the backers of the horse symbol in the area. An altercation ensued, and at one point Osman was struck on the head with a sharp weapon.\n\nHe was initially taken to Bagerhat Sadar Hospital in critical condition and later shifted to Khulna Medical College Hospital as his condition deteriorated. He died around 11:30am on Saturday while undergoing treatment.\n\nOfficer-in-Charge Md. Masum Khan of Bagerhat Model Police Station said police were deployed to the area after news of Osman’s death spread. Authorities have launched an investigation into the incident and are working to identify those involved.\n\nIn the parliamentary election for the Bagerhat-2 (Sadar–Kachua) constituency, the BNP-nominated candidate was Sheikh Mohammad Zakir Hossain. The party’s former district president and former MP for the seat, MAH Selim, contested as an independent “rebel” candidate. Both were defeated by a large margin by Jamaat-e-Islami nominee Sheikh Manjurul Haque Rahad.",

He further claimed that presiding officers stamped ballot papers themselves on election day.\n\nAccording to Aminul, on the night of February 11, the Jamaat candidate entered polling centers and went into the rooms of presiding officers. He alleged that results were “engineered” at several targeted centers and that some result sheets lacked the signatures of polling agents.\n\nHe also accused government authorities of influencing the election outcome.\n\nAccording to the officially declared results, Abdul Baten, contesting with the “Scales” symbol, secured 88,828 votes in Dhaka-16.

    "body": "Professor Ali Riaz, special assistant to the chief adviser, on Saturday said a large majority of voters cast their ballots in favour of reform in the February 12 referendum.\n\nSpeaking at a post-election press conference at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital, he said the outcome reflects clear public support for constitutional reforms proposed in the July National Charter.\n\n“Through this verdict, citizens have very clearly and unequivocally voted in favour of constitutional reform. It is evident that a large number of people do not want to return to the old system or maintain the status quo. They want change and reforms in the state structure,” he said.\n\nCiting Election Commission data, Ali Riaz said 77,695,023 voters participated in the referendum, representing 60.84% turnout. Of them, 48,200,660 voters—68.6% of the total cast—voted ‘yes’, while 22,071,726 voters, or about 31%, voted ‘no’.\n\nHe noted that turnout in the referendum exceeded that of the parliamentary election by around one percentage point.\n\nAli Riaz said the verdict should not be viewed solely in numerical terms. “This reflects the responsibility entrusted to us by those who sacrificed their lives and those who were injured in the August 2024 uprising,” he added.\n\nResponding to a question on the formation of an upper house of parliament, he said the structure would be determined in line with the referendum results, and that the elected government would take the next steps. “It is not the time to make a final decision,” he said, adding that political parties have pledged commitment to reform.\n\nOn another query, he said Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus has expressed his intention to return to his previous profession in the future and is preparing for that transition.\n\nAli Riaz said implementing the referendum verdict is the responsibility of all political parties—both those in parliament and those outside it—and called for dialogue and cooperation to ensure reform.\n\nHe also congratulated the newly elected members of parliament and the political parties, as well as voters for participating peacefully in the electoral process.\n\nChief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam was also present at the briefing.",

Photo : PID\n\nDHAKA, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS) - The Council of Advisers today adopted a formal resolution expressing gratitude to all concerned for their outstanding contribution in holding a successful, historic and festive national election.\n\nThe advisers approved the resolution at its 61st weekly meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office (CAO) here with Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus in the chair.\n\nLater, Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam briefed the media at the Foreign Service Academy here this afternoon to share outcomes of the meeting.\n\nHe said, during the meeting, the advisers described the 13th parliamentary elections as \"a successful and historic festive election\" while the Chief Adviser thanked all concerned for their outstanding performance in holding the polls.\n\nThe press secretary said that members of the advisory council also individually expressed their appreciation.\n\nHe said the Council of Advisers extended special thanks to Home Affairs Adviser Lieutenant General (Retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury for his ministry's role in holding the elections, observing that Bangladesh might not have ever witnessed such a better election.\n\nThe advisers also extended thanks to all law enforcement agencies under the Home Ministry, including the police, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Coast Guard and Ansar, and the Armed Forces for their praise-worthy performance to make the election successful and historic once.\n\nShafiqul Alam said that the Council of Advisers also approved a vote of thanks to immediate past Cabinet Secretary Dr Sheikh Abdur Rashid for his contribution to hold the elections in a free, fair, peaceful and festive manner by successfully managing the administration.\n\nInformation and Broadcasting Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan moved the thanksgiving motion while the Council approved it.\n\nThe advisory council also observed that this election achieved unprecedented success in many respects.\n\nOne major point highlighted was that, for the first time, a strong opposition will be visible in parliament-comprising individuals who were victims of enforced disappearance and killings, as well as those who were in the front lines of the July Revolution-ensuring broad-based representation of Bangladeshi society.\n\nThe advisers also highlighted the representation of the people, who were victims of enforced disappearance and killings, in the treasury bench in the parliament.\n\nThe Council of Advisers also noted that, unlike in previous elections when post-election violence against minorities had been reported, no such incidents have been heard this time.\n\nReligious minority communities and female voters were seen voting in a festive mood without reports of attacks on their homes or properties, they observed.\n\nThe advisory council praised the extensive use of technology including body-worn cameras, ‘Surokkha App’ and CCTV cameras, in managing the election for the first time since the Chief Adviser personally observed live feeds from Police Headquarters and spoke with officials at 17 polling centres in real time through body-worn cameras.\n\nThe council termed this use of technology unprecedented and expressed hope that expanded deployment in future elections would yield even better results.\n\nProf Yunus observed that the body-worn cameras will now become a key component of election management in Bangladesh, enabling real-time monitoring of voting processes.\n\nThe advisory council also hailed the interim government’s initiative of introducing the postal ballots to involve the Bangladeshi diaspora in the elections.\n\nThe advisers also praised the Election Commission’s firm and independent role to make the election a successful, free, fair and festive one.\n\nThey noted that this was the least violent election in Bangladesh’s history. By comparison, the 1991 election following the fall of Ershad—often considered the best to date—saw violence in 87 polling centres, whereas this election witnessed only marginal incidents, the advisers observed.\n\nDuring the meeting, Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury informed that though deaths of four people were reported during the election time, only one was genuinely related to election violence.\n\nRegarding the post-election incident involving a girl in Hatiya, he informed that a probe committee has been formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.\n\nReferring to international election observers, the Council of Advisers observed that all the foreign observers including the European Union (EU) Election Observer Mission, Commonwealth, International Republican Institute (IRI) and ANFREL highly praised the polls management.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain informed that foreign ministers from SAARC countries have been invited, along with the foreign minister of Qatar, to join the oath taking ceremony of the Members of Parliament and cabinet members of the incoming government on Tuesday.\n\nShafiqul Alam said that the meeting concluded with the Chief Adviser’s remarks, “We are lucky people who got the opportunity to serve the nation”.\n\nHe also said that prior to the advisory council meeting; the Cabinet Committee on Pay Scale held its first meeting and discussed various aspects of the pay scale implementation.\n\nChief Adviser’s Senior Assistant Press Secretary Foyez Ahammad and Assistant Press Secretary Shuchismita Tithi were present at the briefing.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON, United States, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Former US president Barack Obama criticized a lack of shame and decorum in the country's political discourse, responding Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump's social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys.\n\nThe video shared on Trump's Truth Social account on February 5 sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting \"fake outrage\" only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.\n\nNear the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump's 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas -- the first Black president and first lady in US history -- were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.\n\nObama responded to the video for the first time in an interview with left-wing political podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen released Saturday.\n\n\"The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before...Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape's body,\" Cohen said in the interview.\n\n\"And so again, we've seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?\"\n\nWithout naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans \"find this behavior deeply troubling.\"\n\n\"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That's been lost.\"\n\nObama predicted such messaging will hurt Trump's Republicans in midterm elections, that \"ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people.\"\n\nTrump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video's claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.",

His customer sales have dropped by 30 percent.\n\nTo afford the property, he has diversified operations at Oakdale into winemaking and hosting events like weddings.\n\n- 'State of crisis' -\n\nSteeper beef prices have become a symbol of high living costs in the world's biggest economy, which has fueled voter frustration. Last fall, Trump demanded that ranchers slash their prices.\n\nTrump has since exempted Brazilian beef from sharp tariffs, and moved this month to expand imports of trimmings from Argentina to cool ground beef prices.\n\nYet, officials predict costs will keep creeping up.\n\nBeef and veal prices were up 15 percent year-on-year in January while ground beef prices, which hit a new high in December, have continued climbing.\n\nCosts will likely stay elevated as consumer demand remains robust, while it takes years to rebuild American herds depleted by drought and import restrictions over a parasite.\n\nMeanwhile, American farmers and ranchers fear Trump's policies will undercut their production and profits.\n\n\"We do need to feed the people of the United States,\" said Stem. \"But we're opening a door that's going to, I think, significantly harm farmers.\"\n\n\"I'm a supporter of the Republican administration,\" he added. \"I'm not a supporter of the of the unknowns that we get right now.\"\n\nThe Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America warned recently: \"Our industry is in a state of crisis and needs protection against price-depressing imports.\"\n\nIowa farmer Lance Lillibridge told AFP that cattle producers have been \"living off very skinny margins\" for years.\n\n\"People are getting tired of working this hard for nothing,\" he added. \"Right now, our cattle prices are exactly where they should be.\"\n\n- 'Cut back' -\n\nBut households are feeling the pinch.\n\nEndawnson Nungo, 56, a South Carolinian in the railroad industry, told AFP \"we've cut back a lot\" due to beef prices.\n\nAt a butcher shop in Washington, scientist Caleb Svezia, 28, said he started noticing higher meat prices around six months ago.\n\nHe has cut back on snacks when grocery shopping, to save up for better quality meats.\n\nJamie Stachowski, who runs Stachowski's Market, said customers have pulled back. Like Stem, he has had to raise prices, lifting them by 30 percent over the past year.\n\nIn turn, his sales dropped by 15 percent.\n\nSome consumers also pivoted from prime cuts to secondary ones -- or buy other meats altogether.\n\n\"The beef industry is billions and billions of dollars,\" he said. \"Yet everybody just makes pennies on the pound.\"",

    "body": "LONDON, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Larry the cat, the UK's most famous feline, marks 15 years on Sunday as the country's chief mouser patrolling the corridors of power around number 10 Downing Street.\n\nHere are four things to know about the purr-fect puss who over the years has charmed his way into the hearts of some of the world's top politicians.\n\n- Humble roots -\n\nRecruited to deal with a rodent problem, Larry arrived at the prime minister's official residence on February 15, 2011.\n\nHe was adopted from the renowned London animal shelter, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, when he was believed to be about four years old. David Cameron was prime minister at the time.\n\nSince then, the white and tabby cat, officially introduced on Downing Street's website as the \"Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office\", has reigned supreme from the country's most photographed doorstep.\n\nHis official biography on the Downing Street website says apart from rodent control: \"Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality.\"\n\n- Six prime ministers -\n\nHe has lived through six prime ministers, from Cameron to Keir Starmer, weathered the storms of Brexit, Covid-19, the chaos of \"partygate,\" Liz Truss's 49?day whirlwind occupation, and the more orderly months under Rishi Sunak.\n\nNothing seems to ruffle his fur as this political veteran glides from crisis to crisis with feline calm, and the lick of a paw.\n\nA media darling, Larry, who is now believed to be around 19, often steals the spotlight from visiting foreign leaders.\n\nIn December, he was on the doorstep to greet the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn January, he even sent a photographer stumbling on the red carpet after darting unexpectedly between his legs during a visit by Poland's president.\n\n- Cat-fluencer -\n\nA whiskered influencer, Larry also boasts an X account @Number10cat followed by more than 877,500 fans.\n\nRun by an anonymous user, Larry grumbles about getting caught in the rain and sometimes takes catty swipes at politicians, notably UK Reform and the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nHis first months \"in office\" even inspired a book, \"The Larry Diaries\", published in 2011.\n\nLarry now shares the No. 10 residence with JoJo and Prince, the Starmer family cats.\n\nPrince, a Siberian, joined the household in 2024 after \"negotiations\" with Starmer's children -- who had wanted a German Shepherd dog.\n\nBut there was a problem: \"the only door out of our new flat is bomb proof,\" Starmer told the BBC in 2024. \"Therefore, getting a cat flap is proving a little bit difficult.\"\n\nLarry's fans can relax though: he is considered a permanent civil servant, which means he gets to stay at Downing Street for good. Unlike prime ministers.\n\n- Famous felines -\n\nLarry is not alone in being a feline companion to politicians.\n\nOn Saturday came sad news that Palmerston, a black-and-white cat, once mouser to the Foreign Office and \"Diplocat extraordinaire\", had passed away in Bermuda where he retired in 2020.\n\n\"Farewell old friend x,\" Larry posted on his X account, brushing aside rumours of rivalry between the pair.\n\nUnder former US president Bill Clinton, the black-and-white cat Socks took up residence in the White House from 1993 to 2001.\n\nOnce a stray, Socks became the star of several books and was often featured by the UK cartoonist Steve Bell in his daily comic strips.\n\nAnd in Belgium, a rescue cat named Maximus has shot to social media stardom as the bewhiskered sidekick and PR weapon of Prime Minister Bart De Wever.",

    "body": "Son of Iran's last shah urges US action as supporters rally in Munich\n\nMUNICH, Germany, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - The exiled son of Iran's last shah said he was ready to lead the country to a \"secular democratic future\" at a rally in Munich on Saturday, after US President Donald Trump said a change of power would be the \"best thing\".\n\nIt came as Washington continued to engage diplomatically with Tehran's government, with Switzerland on Saturday confirming that mediator Oman would host a fresh round of talks in Geneva next week.\n\nUS-based Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, told the crowd of around 200,000 people of his supporters that he could lead a transition.\n\n\"I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future,\" he said.\n\n\"I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box.\"\n\n\"Javid shah\" (long live the shah),\" the crowd chanted as they waved green-white-and-red flags with a lion and a sun -- the emblem of the toppled monarchy.\n\n\"The Iranian regime is a dead regime,\" a 62-year-old protester originally from Iran who gave his name only as Said told AFP. \"It must be game over.\"\n\nPahlavi has urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrating, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8:00 pm (1630 GMT) Saturday and Sunday, to coincide with protests in Germany and elsewhere.\n\nThousands of protesters in various demonstrations from downtown Los Angeles to the National Mall in Washington marched in solidarity Saturday with anti-government protests in Iran.\n\n\"Trump act now!\" demonstrators chanted in Toronto.\n\nTrump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the \"best thing that could happen\", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on Tehran.\n\nHe had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.\n\n\"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them,\" Pahlavi had earlier told reporters gathered at the Munich Security Conference.\n\n\"It is time to end the Islamic republic,\" he said.\n\n- Iranian opposition divided -\n\nWhen Iran began its crackdown, Trump initially said the United States was \"locked and loaded\" to help demonstrators.\n\nBut he has more recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear programme, which US forces struck last June during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.\n\nRepresentatives of Iran and the United States, which have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the 1979 revolution, held talks on the nuclear programme last week in Oman.\n\nOn Sunday, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP that Oman would host talks in Geneva next week, without providing further details.\n\nVideos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the ongoing crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.\n\nAccording to US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 7,010 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though they and other rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.\n\nMore than 53,845 people have been arrested, it added.\n\nPahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by \"terrorists\" fuelled by their sworn enemies, the United States and Israel.\n\nMany protest chants had called for the monarchy's return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition.\n\nThe Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father's autocratic rule.\n\nTrump declined on Friday to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that \"there are people\".",

    "body": "PARIS, France, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWith Epstein's known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents by the US authorities, the prosecutor's office said it would also thoroughly re-examine the case of a former French modelling agency executive, Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the American financier who died in custody in 2022.\n\nThe new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor's office told AFP.\n\nThe aim is \"to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework\", it said.\n\nBrunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors. The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.\n\nProsecutors said an investigation had shown Brunel was \"a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein\" who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.\n\nBrunel had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south of France, they said.\n\nTen women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor's office.\n\n- New cases -\n\nSeveral French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.\n\nAt the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.\n\n\"An investigation is underway to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report,\" the prosecutor's office stated.\n\nThe prosecutor's office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of \"sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990\", it said.\n\nThe office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frederic Chaslin alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.\n\nThe latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as the head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute (IMA).\n\nLang has however denied any wrongdoing, saying he was \"shocked\" that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company Epstein founded in 2016.\n\nThe office of the national financial prosecutor said it had opened a preliminary investigation for \"aggravated tax fraud and money laundering\" against Lang and his daughter Caroline Lang.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Lang resigned from the presidency of the IMA.\n\nIn an interview in newspaper La Tribune Dimanche, out on Sunday, Lang once again insists he is \"white as snow\", denouncing what he describes as \"a tsunami of lies\" against him.\n\nHe told the paper he had known nothing of Epstein's 2008 conviction for procuring a child for prostitution.\n\nEpstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking underage girls. The US authorities ruled his death was a suicide.",

Ukraine has ruled out surrendering its eastern regions.\n\nOf the talks so far, Zelensky said: \"The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine.\"\n\nHe also drew parallels between the current talks and the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler take part of Czechoslovakia only for the Second World War to break out the following year.\n\n\"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine -- just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war,\" he warned.\n\nKyiv was doing \"everything\" to end the war, he said, insisting that viable security guarantees were the only way to get to a deal and prevent future Russian aggression.\n\n\"With Russia, you cannot leave a single loophole Russians can use to start a war,\" he said.\n\nZelensky again argued that there would be more chance of ending the war if European countries had a seat at the negotiating table -- something Russia has opposed.\n\nNext week's talks in Geneva between the two sides will come after two rounds of US-Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn a social media post Zelensky said he had spoken by phone to US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner ahead of the talks.\n\n\"We count on the meetings being truly productive,\" he added.\n\nBut with no diplomatic breakthrough so far, the Ukrainian leader has called on his Western allies to make faster political decisions.\n\n\"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them,\" Zelensky said. The Iranian-designed Shahed drones that Russia was using had become much more deadly, he noted.\n\nReturning to the question of elections in Ukraine, Zelensky said they would be held once Kyiv received security guarantees and a ceasefire had been agreed.",

Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal.\"\n\nOther members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.\n\nThe foursome are replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history.\n\nThe ISS, which orbits 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.\n\nNASA declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the previous mission short.\n\nCrew-12 will be one of the last crews to live aboard the football field-sized space station.\n\nContinuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the aging ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.\n\n- Microgravity and the human body -\n\nDuring their eight months on the outpost, the astronauts will conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies.\n\nMeir, who previously worked as a marine biologist studying animals in extreme environments, will serve as the crew's commander.\n\nAdenot has become the second French woman to fly into space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station.\n\nAmong other research, she will test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds.\n\n\"I am proud to bring France and Europe along on this incredible adventure that transcends borders,\" Adenot said.\n\n\"Count on me to share every step with you and bring a sparkle to the eyes of the French people.\"\n\nThe ISS, once a symbol of warming post-Cold War relations, has been a rare area of continued cooperation between the West and Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nHowever, the space station has not entirely avoided the tensions back on Earth.\n\nIn November, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev -- who had long been planned to be a member of Crew-12 -- was suddenly taken off the mission.\n\nReports from independent media in Russia suggested he had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone while training at a SpaceX facility. Russian space agency Roscosmos merely said he had been transferred to a different job.\n\nHis replacement, Fedyaev, has already spent some time on the ISS as part of Crew-6 in 2023.",

    "body": "CARACAS, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Relatives of political prisoners in Venezuela launched a hunger strike Saturday outside a prison in Caracas, as talks drag on over the adoption of a promised amnesty law.\n\nThe historic amnesty is the centerpiece of reforms undertaken by acting President Delcy Rodriguez since US special forces captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro in a deadly January 3 raid on Caracas.\n\nIt aims to turn the page on nearly three decades of state repression, and is expected to cover all charges brought against dissidents who opposed the rule of Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez over the past 27 years.\n\nA mass liberation of prisoners promised on January 8 did not materialize, with authorities instead freeing detainees little by little -- leaving dozens of families camped outside prison facilities waiting for answers.\n\nIn Caracas, a group of about 10 women wearing medical face masks lay down in a line at the entrance to a national police facility known as Zone 7.\n\nMany of them were sleeping, with one telling AFP, on condition of anonymity: \"Sleeping eases the hunger.\"\n\n\"We hope to stay here until everyone is released,\" Evelin Quiaro, 46, an immigration official and the mother of a political prisoner, told AFP.\n\nQuiaro, whose son has been in detention since November on terror-related charges, said she had eaten her last meal at about 1 am.\n\n\"We've already been waiting a very long time,\" she said, calling the hunger strike \"a drastic measure that we believe is necessary to finish this once and for all.\"\n\n- 'Democratic coexistence' -\n\nHours earlier, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez announced the release of 17 prisoners in a post on social media, without naming them.\n\nHe called for Venezuelans to \"continue this path of peace for the construction of democratic coexistence.\"\n\nOne of those freed was union leader Jose Elias Torres, who had been held since November, an advocacy group said.\n\nThe amnesty legislation covers charges of \"treason,\" \"terrorism\" and spreading \"hate\" that were used to lock up dissidents, according to the bill text.\n\nBut on Thursday, after backing the amnesty bill on a first reading, lawmakers postponed its adoption after failing to reach an agreement on how to apply it.\n\nPro-government and opposition lawmakers clashed over an article requiring would-be beneficiaries to appear in court to request amnesty.\n\nThey agreed to continue the debate on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the non-governmental organization Foro Penal, 431 political prisoners have been offered conditional release so far, and 644 are still behind bars.\n\nEmil Brandt, regional coordinator for the political party of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, arrived in his hometown of Barinas on Saturday, after two years in detention.\n\n\"It's important to highlight that our work continues. We still have people behind bars, and we will not rest until justice is served and they regain their freedom,\" Brandt said.\n\n\"The people (of Venezuela) deserve to live better, and that will be the case when our leader Maria Corina Machado comes home.\"\n\nSpeaking to a security conference in Munich, Machado did not say when that return might come.\n\n- US pressure -\n\nRodriguez, Maduro's vice president, took over as the South American country's leader with the consent of US President Donald Trump -- provided that she toes Washington's line.\n\nThe United States has taken control of Venezuela's oil sales, with Trump vowing a share for Washington in the profits.\n\nThe Trump administration has also pressured Rodriguez to release political prisoners.\n\nAs the post-Maduro transition takes hold, the fear once instilled by the state is beginning to dissipate.\n\nThousands of opposition supporters poured into the streets of Caracas ahead of the debate over the amnesty bill to demand the release of all remaining political prisoners.",

    "body": "CAPE TOWN, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Five years after becoming Africa's first Covid-era debt defaulter, Zambia is seeing a dramatic turnaround in fortunes as major powers vie for access to its vast reserves of copper.\n\nSurging demand from the artificial intelligence, green energy and defence sectors has exponentially boosted demand for the workhorse metal that underpins power grids, data centres and electric vehicles.\n\nThe scramble for copper exposes geopolitical rivalries as industrial heavyweights -- including China, the United States, Canada, Europe, India and Gulf states -- compete to secure supplies.\n\n\"We have the investors back,\" President Hakainde Hichilema told delegates at the African Mining Indaba conference on Monday, saying that more than $12 billion had flowed into the sector since 2022.\n\nThe politically stable country is Africa's second-largest copper producer, after the conflict-ridden Democratic Republic of Congo, and the world's eighth, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nThe metal, needed for solar panels and wind turbines, generates about 15 percent of Zambia's GDP and more than 70 percent of export earnings.\n\nOutput rose eight percent last year to more than 890,000 metric tons and the government aims to triple production within a decade.\n\nMining is driving growth that is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to reach 5.2 percent in 2025 and 5.8 percent this year, which places Zambia among the continent's faster-growing economies.\n\n\"The seeds are sprouting and the harvest is coming,\" Hichilema said, touting a planned nationwide geological survey to map untapped deposits.\n\nBut the rapid expansion of the heavily polluting industry has also led to warnings about risks to local communities and concerns of \"pit-to-port\" extraction, in which raw copper is shipped directly abroad with little domestic refining.\n\n- 'Dramatic new chapter' -\n\n\"We need to be aware of the potential for history to repeat itself,\" said Daniel Litvin, founder of the Resource Resolutions group that promotes sustainable development, referring to the colonial-era scramble for Africa's resources.\n\nThere is a risk that elites will be enriched at the expense of the broader population, while \"narratives of partnership\" offered by major powers can mask underlying self-interest, he said.\n\nChinese firms have long dominated the sector in Zambia and control major stakes in key mines and smelters, cementing Beijing's early-mover advantage.\n\nAnother major player is Canada's First Quantum Minerals, Zambia's largest corporate taxpayer.\n\nInvestors from India and the Gulf are expanding their footprint, and the United States is returning to the market after largely pulling out decades ago.\n\nWashington, which has been stockpiling copper, this month launched a $12 billion \"Project Vault\" public-private initiative to secure critical minerals, part of an effort to reduce reliance on China.\n\nIn September, the US Trade and Development Agency announced a $1.4 million grant to a Metalex Commodities subsidiary, Metalex Africa, to expand operations in Zambia.\n\n\"We are at the beginning of what is going to unfold to be a dramatic new chapter in the way that the free world sources and trades in critical minerals,\" US energy secretary adviser Mike Kopp said at Mining Indaba.\n\nSweeping US tariffs introduced last year helped send copper prices soaring to record highs, as companies rushed to buy both semi-finished and refined stocks.\n\n- Cost of rush -\n\n\"The risk is that this great power competition becomes a race to secure supply on terms that serve markets and not the people in producer countries,\" said Deprose Muchena, a programme director at the Open Society Foundation.\n\nDespite its mineral wealth, more than 70 percent of Zambia's 21 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\n\"The world is waking up to Zambia's copper. But Zambia has been living with copper and its consequences for a century,\" Muchena told AFP.\n\nEnvironmental damage caused by mining has long plagued Zambia's copper belt.\n\nIn February 2025, a burst tailings dam at a Chinese-owned mine near Kitwe, about 285 kilometres (180 miles) north of Lusaka, spilled millions of litres of acidic waste.\n\nToxins entered a tributary feeding the Kafue, Zambia's longest river and a major source of drinking water. Zambian farmers have filed an $80 billion lawsuit.\n\n\"Whether this boom is different depends on whether governance, rights, and community agency are at the centre, not just supply chain security,\" Muchena said.",

Keep it simple.\"\n\nRyding said the Bormio piste was a \"more mellow slope than we normally race\".\n\n\"I think you'll see some names that you really don't expect up there. Hopefully I can be one of them.\n\n\"Obviously like any Games, everyone loves to talk about a medal. It would be amazing, but it certainly won't totally define me. But that's why I'm here, right? I'm here to give myself that that chance.\n\n\"I said to myself two years ago that I thought I left a little bit on the table in the major events, the Olympics and the world championships.\n\n\"This year I'm really trying to better what I've done before, which was ninth in Pyeongchang. So that's where my mind's at and that's why I'm here. On Monday I have a fighting chance.\"\n\nRyding added that experience does not count as much in Bormio as on traditionally tough courses such as Wengen or Kitzbuehel.\n\n\"It's much more about full throttle skiing,\" he said, warning that the younger skiers might be more nimble than \"the old fox\".\n\nRyding said none of his family will be present for his fifth Olympics.\n\n\"It's just me, myself and I. All I'm going to do is try and have as much energy as I can for Monday, go home on Tuesday and then share some time with them,\" he said.\n\n\"This year's been about being in a position to compete on Monday, that's been the steadfast thing and I've not really thought about anything else.\"",

    "body": "PARIS, France, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Lens reclaimed the lead atop Ligue 1 on Saturday with a Wesley Said-inspired 5-0 romp over Paris FC, while a late penalty condemned Marseille to a draw with Strasbourg.\n\nA third consecutive league victory, coupled with Paris Saint-Germain slipping up 3-1 at Rennes on Friday, sent Pierre Sage's side one point clear of the champions.\n\nBraces by Said and Rayan Fofana, either side of a Florian Thauvin penalty, moved Lens to 52 points, while struggling PFC remain in 15th place, eight points above the relegation zone.\n\n\"Whenever we have the opportunity, we will do everything we can to take first place and keep it,\" Thauvin told L1+.\n\n\"We know it will be difficult, there's a lot of matches left... We're not getting carried away. We keep going.\"\n\nThe visitors tore out of the blocks at Stade Jean-Bouin as Said hit the post and Florian Thauvin had a goal disallowed for offside inside the opening quarter-hour.\n\nBut they were not to be contained for long as Odsonne Edouard teed up Said to open the scoring in the 24th minute.\n\nEdouard was then denied by the flag minutes later, before Said doubled Lens' advantage seven minutes before the break when he capped off a fine team move with a flashing finish into the top corner.\n\n2018 World Cup winner Thauvin made the points safe just shy of the hour as he slammed home from the spot after Otavio had fouled Saud Abdulhamid.\n\nFofana and Allan Saint-Maximin, on in place of Edouard and Said, continued the tormenting of PFC as they combined to add two goals in stoppage time.\n\n- 'Struggling a lot' -\n\nMarseille began life after Roberto De Zerbi with a 2-2 home draw with Strasbourg despite leading by two goals late into the second period.\n\nThe Italian coach left the south coast club earlier in the week following last Sunday's 5-0 thrashing to fierce rivals PSG.\n\nGoals from Mason Greenwood and Amine Gouiri seemed to be enough to give interim boss Jacques Abardonado a vital three points.\n\nBut Sebastian Nanasi's second-half strike set up a nervy finale at the Stade Velodrome before Joaquin Panichelli converted a penalty deep into injury time.\n\nThe late collapse condemned Marseille to remaining in fourth place, 11 points off the pace.\n\n\"It's becoming a recurring theme. It's the same scenario as against Paris FC, where we were already leading 2-0 and then conceded a penalty in added time,\" Abardonado said.\n\n\"The team is maybe not sick, but it is struggling a lot. When it happens again and again like this, it's difficult.\"\n\nThe draw kept Gary O'Neil's Strasbourg seventh in the table on 31 points.\n\nWith large swathes of the stands empty as protesting Marseille fans waited until the 15th minute to come in, the hosts took the lead in a subdued atmosphere when Greenwood outpaced Andrew Omobamidele and dinked home.\n\nStrasbourg dominated the remainder of the half but failed to break down Marseille.\n\nAbardonado's charges punished the visitors two minutes after half-time as Gouiri fired his fifth goal of the league campaign.\n\nThe away side continued to see the most of the ball, but as they failed to make a breakthrough O'Neil made changes.\n\nNanasi came on just after the hour and netted in the 73rd minute after good wide play by Martial Godo.\n\nMarseille looked set to see out the win until Emerson Palmieri caught subsitute Gessime Yassine while trying to clear the ball and the referee pointed to the spot deep into stoppage time.\n\nPanichelli stepped up and dispatched the resulting spot-kick in the 97th minute to ensure the spoils were shared at the Velodrome.\n\nLille climbed to fifth in the table, six points behind Marseille, with a 1-1 home draw against Brest thanks to Gaetan Perrin's 71st-minute leveller for the hosts after Remy Labeau-Lascary had given the Breton side the lead earlier in the second half.",

Barrister Putul is the daughter of late BNP leader and former State\n\nMinister for Youth and Sports Fazlur Rahman Patal.\n\nAfter 18 years, she regained her father's former constituency by securing\n\nparty nomination and winning the election.\n\nFazlur Rahman Patal had served as an adviser to BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda\n\nZia and was elected MP from this constituency four consecutive times in 1991,\n\n1996, and 2001.\n\nHe served as State Minister for Youth and Sports from 2001 to 2006. In the\n\n2008 election, the seat slipped from BNP's control after Patal was defeated\n\nby Jatiya Party candidate MA Talha.\n\nLater, in 2014, Awami League candidate Abul Kalam Azad was elected unopposed\n\nfrom the seat.\n\nFazlur Rahman Patal passed away in 2015.\n\nIn the 2018 election, his wife received the party nomination but lost to\n\nAwami League candidate Shahidul Islam Bakul.\n\nAs BNP did not participate in the 2024 election, no member of the Patal\n\nfamily contested that year. After a long 18 years, his daughter Barrister\n\nPutul has now reclaimed the seat.\n\nBy profession, Barrister Farzana Sharmin Putul is a Supreme Court lawyer. She\n\ncurrently serves as Special Assistant to the BNP Chairperson's Foreign\n\nAffairs Advisory Committee, a member of the Human Rights Committee, and a\n\nmember of the party's Media Cell.\n\nAccording to the election results, she secured 102,726 votes to win. Her\n\nnearest rival, Jamaat-nominated candidate Abul Kalam Azad, received 90,568\n\nvotes while Independent candidate Taiful Islam Tipu came third with 73,173\n\nvotes, contesting under the \"Pitcher\" symbol.\n\nHowever, Putul's victory was not easy. She faced various challenges in\n\nparticipating in the election.\n\nThere was even family rivalry over party nomination, as her elder brother,\n\nDr. Yasir Arshad Rajan, was also vocal in seeking the nomination.\n\nAdditionally, she faced strong competition from independent candidate Taiful\n\nIslam Tipu, who had served as BNP's central co-office secretary.\n\nFor contesting against the party's \"Sheaf of Paddy\" symbol in defiance of\n\nparty directives, he was expelled from all party posts, including his primary\n\nmembership.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Barrister Putul was reportedly subjected to\n\ncyberbullying. It was also alleged that some leaders within the party worked\n\nin favor of the rebel candidate. Among them were former Bagatipara Upazila\n\nChairman Jahangir Hossain, municipal mayor Shariful Islam Lelin, former\n\nGopalpur Municipality Mayor of Lalpur and former BNP leader Munjurul Islam\n\nBimal along with several others.\n\nOvercoming these adversities, she ultimately succeeded in crossing the\n\nelectoral hurdle.\n\nAfter her victory, Barrister Farzana Sharmin Putul said, \"BNP honored the\n\npeople of this constituency by nominating me and, the people of this\n\nconstituency, in return, have honored the party to elect me as the MP. I will\n\nnot judge anyone based on who voted or who did not vote for me. I want to\n\nwork with everyone.\"\n\nShe further added, \"Not only for this constituency or Natore district, but if\n\ngiven the opportunity, I'm ready to work for the country.\"",

Photo: collected\n\nDHAKA, Feb 14, 2026 (BSS) - Commonwealth Observer Group today termed the 13th National Parliament Election in Bangladesh, held on February 12, as transparent, free, peaceful and acceptable.\n\n\"It (the election) was acceptable, it was peaceful throughout, and it was transparent,\" said Chairperson of the Commonwealth Observer Group and former President of Ghana Nana Addo Akufo-Addo at a press briefing at a city hotel here.\n\nDelivering the interim statement at the briefing after observing the February 12 parliamentary election and the referendum on the July Charter, Akufo-Addo said the overall electoral process was conducted in a peaceful, orderly and largely transparent manner.\n\nHe commended the people of Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Election Commission (BEC), law enforcement agencies and the interim government for ensuring an environment conducive to voting across the country.\n\n\"The Commonwealth is honoured to have been invited by the Chief Election Commissioner,\" he said, noting that the 13-member Observer Group was constituted by Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Botchwey and comprised experts in politics, law, media, gender and election administration from different Commonwealth regions.\n\nThe Group was deployed across Bangladesh's eight divisions ahead of polling day to assess the pre-election environment, campaign activities and election day procedures.\n\nIn its preliminary findings, the Observer Group described election day as peaceful, with polling stations opening on time and voting procedures implemented professionally.\n\nBallot materials were distributed in advance, and officials adhered to prescribed guidelines during pre-poll preparations.\n\nVoting was conducted calmly and largely in accordance with established procedures, the Group observed. Although a few isolated incidents were reported, these did not appear to affect the overall conduct of the election in a systemic manner.\n\nObservers also noted that relevant voter information was clearly displayed at polling centres, separate queues were maintained for men and women, and most stations were divided into multiple streams to facilitate efficient queue management.\n\nThe Group followed the results process from polling stations to returning officers' centres in several constituencies and described the counting of ballots, including postal ballots, as transparent.\n\nSecurity arrangements were commended as well coordinated and effective. Police and other security officials were present at polling stations, while CCTV cameras and body-worn cameras were deployed to enhance oversight without compromising the integrity of the process.\n\nThe extension of postal ballots to overseas voters and inmates was termed a \"laudable development\" aimed at expanding enfranchisement. However, the Group said further efforts are needed to strengthen transparency and public confidence in the logistics of implementation.\n\nOn participation and inclusion, the Observer Group praised the large turnout of women voters and noted the visible participation of women as polling officials and security personnel.\n\nNevertheless, it expressed concern over the low percentage of women candidates, at four percent and the election of only seven women to parliament.\n\nThe Group indicated that it would recommend measures to encourage greater participation of women in future electoral processes, including addressing prevailing challenges such as online harassment and structural barriers within party hierarchies.\n\nYouth engagement in political mobilization was also acknowledged as increasingly visible, though observers suggested that greater institutional inclusion of young people within formal political structures would further strengthen democratic participation.\n\nThe Group further observed that election and security officials assisted persons with disabilities (PWDs) and elderly voters.\n\nRegarding the July Charter referendum, the Commonwealth recognized it as a response to urgent demands for reform but noted that some stakeholders had expressed concerns over the consultative depth and clarity of communication surrounding the process.\n\nThe Bangladeshi media was described as vibrant and active, with extensive coverage of election-related developments contributing to public engagement and strengthening political discourse.\n\nIn its conclusion, the Group acknowledged isolated reports of post-election tensions and urged all stakeholders to maintain calm and resolve disputes through lawful channels.\n\nLooking ahead, the Observer Group encouraged the Bangladesh Election Commission to conduct a comprehensive post-election review, including consideration of observer recommendations.\n\nIt also urged the establishment of a domestic mechanism to implement recommendations from the Group's forthcoming final report.\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh have exercised their democratic rights to seek the fulfillment of their aspirations,\" Akufo-Addo said, calling for unity and magnanimity in the post-election period.\n\nThe Commonwealth Observer Group's final report, containing detailed findings and recommendations, will be submitted to the Secretary-General and shared with the government, the Election Commission and relevant national stakeholders.",

    "body": "The long-awaited and historic 13th national parliamentary election has been conducted relatively peacefully, overcoming numerous uncertainties and adversities. Voter turnout was reasonably good. However, due to past experiences, many harbour doubts about the real change or benefits that can be achieved despite voting. This lack of trust might be why voter turnout wasn't higher. Nonetheless, the election was generally participatory and inclusive.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the authoritarian kleptocracy, the interim government banned the activities of the Awami League and its student wing, Chhatra League, resulting in the Awami League losing the opportunity to participate institutionally in the election. Consequently, many, domestic and international, may question how inclusive this election was.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that the Awami League remained steadfast in its position of declaring the July mass uprising and the interim government as illegitimate and conspiratorial. They also declared the election illegal and vowed to resist it, actively engaging in this effort during the election period. Therefore, one cannot deny the Awami League’s negative and active role in the election and electoral environment.\n\nHowever, despite the institutional stance of opposing the election, at the grassroots level, Awami League leaders, workers, and supporters participated in the election as voters. Even high-level leaders of the party, who were in prison, exercised their right to vote. A section of the party's supporters may have boycotted the vote, but this applies to ordinary voters as well.",

I couldn’t get much of what I wanted in camera. This is because in order to capture imagination in camera a lot of arrangement is needed. But the experiences from that film is being used in ‘Mission Xtreme’. I think ‘Mission Xtreme’ is going better than ‘Dhaka Attack’.”\n\nRegarding this Sunny also said, “This movie is more dynamic than ‘Dhaka Attack’. In the previous film it was seen that a single person was trying to cause chaos through surgical planning. But in this movie it will be seen that chaos is being created on an organizational level which has a bigger impact on the minds of people. The audience is sure to get more hair rising suspense.”\n\nRead More: Mission Xtreme finishes Dubai operation\n\nThe shooting of ‘Mission Xtreme’ started last March 20 and is supposed to continue until the first week of May. Arefin Shuvo, the protagonist of the film was under strict grooming for nine months prior to the shooting of the film. He is doing his own actions scenes without the use of any dummy.\n\nThe film’s shooting is going on a rapid pace and will end very soon. It supposed to be released at the end of this year.",

Seven, who were put on ICU, were sent to Thailand for better treatment,\" Dr Mahfuzur Rahman said in his testimony.\n\nThe physician said a total 575 people, all with bullet and pellet injuries, received treatment from the hospital's outdoor service.\n\n\"Although, many of them were needed to be admitted at hospital, as there were shortage of beds and we were receiving more serious patients, we could not accommodate them. I led 33 surgeries and pulled out 15 bullets and pellets from the bodies of the patients. We also could not pull out some bullets,\" he added.\n\nNarrating, how they provided treatment to the July protesters, despite the repeated pressure from the law enforcing agencies not to do so, Dr Mahfuzur said officials of detective branch (DB) of police came after July 19, when the flow of injured patients grew at their hospital and pressurized them not to admit any bullet-injured patients or not to release those, who had already been admitted.\n\n\"After that, we started admitting those patients, terming those as road accident victims\" the witness further said.\n\nThe first tribunal on July 10 indicted the ousted prime minister and the other two for the role in crimes against humanity committed during July-August mass uprising.\n\nThe ICT-1 on June 17 published notice in two national dailies, asking ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to surrender on June 24.\n\n\"...as per rules 31 of the International Crimes (Tribunal-1) Rules of Procedure 2010 (Amendment), 2025, they are hereby ordered to surrender at this tribunal on June 24, 2025.

Photo: BSS\n\nDHAKA, Feb 14, 2026 (BSS)- BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman today said that the people of the country are now free from today.\n\nHe said that pro-democracy people of the country have once again made the BNP victorious; and described this victory as a win for Bangladesh and for democracy, pledging to build a safe, humane, and democratic Bangladesh in the days ahead.\n\n\"Alhamdulillah, this victory belongs to Bangladesh. This victory belongs to democracy. This victory belongs to the people who yearn for democracy. From today, we are all free.”\n\nTarique Rahman made the remarks at a post-election press conference held in the Ballroom of the InterContinental Hotel in the city today.\n\nBNP Chairman said the people have paved the way for establishing democracy in the country by overcoming all obstacles. However, he noted that their journey must begin amidst a fragile economy left behind by fascism, dysfunctional constitutional and statutory institutions, and a weak law and order situation.\n\n“After more than one and a half decades, a parliament and government accountable to the people are set to be established through direct voting. Everyone to remain united so that no anti-democratic force can re-establish fascism in the country or turn Bangladesh into a subservient state,” he said.\n\nTarique Rahman extended heartfelt congratulations to the 51 political parties that participated in the election, including Jamaat-e-Islami, NCP, Islami Andolan Bangladesh, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, and Ganadhikar Parishad.\n\n\"In a democratic state and politics, political parties are essentially the lighthouses of democracy. If the government and the opposition each play a responsible role from their respective positions, democracy will undoubtedly become institutionalized,\" he said.\n\nCalling upon every democratic political party that participated in the election to share their ideas for nation-building, he stated, \"Our paths and opinions may be different, but we are all united for the sake of the country. I believe national unity is our strength, and division is our weakness.\"\n\nHe specially thanked the interim government and the Election Commission for successfully holding a peaceful, free, fair, and impartial election, dispelling all public doubts.\n\nTarique Rahman also praised the role of all election-related officials, the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and domestic and international media and observers.\n\nTarique Rahman expressed deep respect for those who were martyred or injured in the movement to establish democracy over this long period from the Liberation War of 1971 to the war to protect the freedom of the country and its people in 2024. He prayed for salvation of their departed souls.\n\nHe also mentioned that the absence of the uncompromising leader and former Prime Miniter Begum Khaleda Zia weighs heavily on the party during this joyous moment.\n\nHe said, \"In anticipation of such a democratic time for establishing people's rights in the state and politics, she fought uncompromisingly against fascism. She never compromised with autocracy or fascism.\"\n\nReferring to BNP’s 31 point 'roadmap for state repair', he said, through consultations with other parties and the public, BNP has formulated its election manifesto.\n\nHighlighting BNP’s signature to the July Charter, Tarique Rahman assured that every commitment made to the people will be implemented in phases.\n\nBNP chairman said his party didn’t bring out any victory processions even after an absolute victory to maintain peace and order, but celebrating the triumph by offering gratitude to Allah.\n\nHe asserted, \"My statement is clear: peace and order must be maintained at any cost. No injustice or illegal activities will be tolerated.\"\n\nHe further said, \"Regardless of party, opinion, religion, or caste, attacks by the powerful on the weak will not be accepted under any pretext. Justice will be the ideal. If the rule of law is not established, all our efforts will go in vain.\"\n\nHe urged everyone to be cautious so that any misunderstandings arising from electoral competition do not turn into revenge or retaliation.\n\nWhile appealing to the pro-democracy people, the BNP Chairman said, \"Just as we played role in the struggle to establish democracy, let us now each to play our part from our respective positions to build Bangladesh as a safe and humane state by controlling corruption, maintaining law and order, and ensuring accountability to the people.\"\n\nConcluding his speech, the BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman once again congratulated and thanked all democratic forces, expatriate Bangladeshis, and the freedom-loving people across the country for the victory.\n\nBNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Standing Committee Member Mirza Abbas, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, Dr Khandakar Mosarrof Hossain, Nazrul Islam Khan, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Major (retd) Hafiz Uddin, Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan, Selima Rahman, Salahuddin Ahmed, Sultan Salauddin Mahmud Tuku,among others were present during the press conference.\n\nJournalists from the local and foreign media joined the press conference.

    "body": "The European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) has overall evaluated the 13th National Parliamentary Election, held on February 12, as \"credible, competitive, and efficiently managed.\" However, the mission simultaneously issued a clear warning regarding several structural weaknesses, institutional gaps, and limitations in democratic inclusion.\n\nChief Observer and Member of the European Parliament, Ivars Ijabs, presented the preliminary statement, describing the election as a \"crucial step toward restoring democratic governance and the rule of law.\" Tomáš Zdechovský, leading the European Parliament delegation, expressed full support for this assessment.\n\nThe EU Mission’s observations highlighted that voters had nearly 2,000 candidates to choose from, and competition was visible. Election day was described as peaceful, orderly, and \"festive.\" The presence of party agents in most centers and the initiative to publish results at the local level helped maintain public confidence. While the mission noted that the legal framework is \"largely consistent\" with international standards and the Bangladesh Election Commission attempted to function independently and transparently, some issues were noted. These included the inconsistent application of security measures during counting and a lack of transparency in result tabulation in three observed instances. Furthermore, most polling stations were not accessible to voters with physical disabilities, signaling a failure to meet inclusive election standards.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chief Observer Ivars Ijabs identified the limited participation of women as the \"most concerning\" issue. Women accounted for only 4 percent of total candidates, a significant deficit for representative democracy. Despite the visible role of women in recent mass movements, they were discouraged by party nomination processes, patriarchal social mindsets, discrimination, and a culture of character assassination. Instances of intimidation, direct harassment, and digital smear campaigns against female candidates were also documented. Observers urged Bangladeshi authorities to follow international conventions on women's rights and take effective measures for political participation.\n\nThe observer team reported that social media was highly active during the campaign. The mission identified at least 23 viral instances of misinformation reaching hundreds of thousands of people. Although national-level fact-checking initiatives existed, platform responses were slow, allowing misleading content to remain active for long periods. They claimed that personal attacks, mutual accusations, and divisive narratives dominated online discussions, weakening the quality of democratic dialogue.\n\nThe EU Mission documented at least 56 incidents of violence during the campaign, resulting in at least 200 casualties across 27 districts. While the violence was primarily local and isolated, it still negatively impacted the electoral atmosphere. When media representatives raised the absence of a major political party (Awami League) despite its historical support base, the Chief Observer stated that the EU monitors elections based on procedural standards. He viewed the high level of competition among participating parties as a \"path to progress.\" Regarding the referendum, Ijabs noted that the EU generally does not monitor referendums as it falls outside their formal mandate, though he remarked that the strong \"Yes\" vote majority creates an obligation for the newly elected government to implement reforms.\n\nOn the topic of transitional justice, the Chief Observer described such issues as \"painful and sensitive,\" but emphasized that elections and the rule of law are the primary paths to political progress. The mission has been in Bangladesh since late 2025, and on election day, 223 international observers from EU member states, Canada, Norway, and Switzerland were deployed across 64 districts. Post-election monitoring will continue, with a final report including recommendations to be published in the coming months.\n\nThe EU Mission’s evaluation frames the 2026 election as a positive step in the democratic journey. However, it made clear that this progress will not be sustainable without increasing female representation, preventing violence, controlling digital misinformation, implementing legal and institutional reforms, and ensuring minority inclusion. Finally, the observers called for the resolution of political disputes through dialogue and the rule of law rather than violence. To sustain the message of democratic renewal emerging from this election, structural reforms and inclusive political commitment are now essential.\n\nIn a press release issued after the conference, the EU stated that the representation of indigenous and religious minority communities remains insufficient. Their political inclusion is limited by the absence of affirmative action or positive discriminatory measures. Furthermore, the observation noted that the media remains under legal and institutional pressure. An increase in self-censorship and the slow pace of media reform processes are reportedly shrinking the democratic space.",

In line with the directive, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has taken preparations to achieve maximum power generation.\n\nBPDB Chairman Engineer Md. Rezaul Karim told Energy Bangla that there will be no problem in electricity supply. “There is currently no shortage. All necessary preparations have been taken to generate the required electricity. As industrial establishments, business entities, and shops will remain closed, overall power demand will be lower. Even then, preparations have been made to generate between 9,000 and 12,000 megawatts of electricity. Adequate stocks of coal and oil have also been ensured,” he said.\n\nAll gas-, oil-, and coal-fired power plants will remain operational. If necessary, additional electricity will be generated from oil-fired power plants.\n\nAhead of the election, electricity imports from India’s Adani have already been increased. On Tuesday, Adani supplied 1,400 megawatts of electricity, compared to the previous 800 megawatts. Adequate coal stocks have also been secured at Rampal, Matarbari, and other power plants.\n\nIn areas where direct grid connection is not possible, instructions have been given to arrange generators or alternative power supply systems. All mobile generators have been asked to remain ready.\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted electricity supply, round-the-clock monitoring will be conducted at both central and local levels. Central and local control centers have been established. Necessary measures have been taken in coordination with Deputy Commissioners in each district to ensure power supply. Alongside BPDB, the Rural Electrification Board (REB) will also maintain constant monitoring. All distribution companies will coordinate with district administrations in their respective areas to ensure power supply. The ministry and relevant departments and agencies will oversee overall coordination.\n\nRecently, Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, in an inter-ministerial meeting, directed that immediate alternative power supply arrangements be kept ready in areas where load shedding is likely.",

The Agreement will provide U.S. and Bangladeshi exporters unprecedented access to each other’s respective markets. The Agreement will build upon our longstanding economic relationship, including the U.S.-Bangladesh Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement (TICFA), signed in 2013.\n\nKey terms of the Agreement will include:\n\n* Bangladesh commits to provide significant preferential market access for U.S. industrial and agricultural goods, including: chemicals; medical devices; machinery and motor vehicles and parts; information and communicational technology (ICT) equipment; energy products; soy products; dairy products; beef; poultry; and tree nuts and fruit.\n\n* The United States will reduce the reciprocal tariff rate, as initially set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, to 19 percent on originating goods of Bangladesh, and will identify products from the list set out in Annex III (Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners) to Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security Agreements) to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate.\n\n* The United States commits to establish a mechanism that will allow for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh to receive a zero reciprocal tariff rate. This mechanism will provide that a to-be-specified volume of apparel and textile imports from Bangladesh can enter the United States at this reduced tariff rate, but this volume shall be determined in relation to the quantity of exports of textiles, e.g. U.S. produced cotton and man-made fiber textile inputs, from the United States.\n\n* The United States and Bangladesh commit to address Bangladesh’s non-tariff barriers that affect bilateral trade and investment in priority areas, including by Bangladesh: accepting vehicles built to U.S. Federal motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; accepting U.S. Food and Drug Administration certificates and prior marketing authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals; and removing any import restrictions or licensing requirement on U.S. remanufactured goods or their parts.\n\n* Bangladesh commits to permit the free transfer of data across trusted borders; support the adoption of a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World Trade Organization; follow science and risk-based processes to allow the import of safe U.S. food and agricultural goods; remove barriers in the insurance market; digitalize its customs procedures; and adopt and implement good regulatory practices.\n\n* Bangladesh commits to protect internationally recognized labor rights, including: adopting and implementing a prohibition on the importation of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor; amending its labor laws to ensure that workers’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining are fully protected; and strengthening enforcement of its labor laws.\n\n* Bangladesh commits to adopt and maintain high levels of environmental protection and effectively enforce its environmental laws; improve customs and trade facilitation; and address distortions caused by subsidies and state-owned enterprises.\n\n* Bangladesh commits to a robust standard for intellectual property protection and enforcement, including ratifying or acceding to and fully implementing certain international intellectual property treaties.\n\n* Bangladesh commits to groundbreaking provisions on geographical indications that will preserve U.S. market access, particularly for U.S. cheese and meat producers who rely on the use of common names.\n\n* The United States and Bangladesh are committed to strengthening economic and national security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address unfair trade practices worldwide, as well as by combatting duty evasion, cooperating on export controls, and sharing information on inbound investment in our respective territories.\n\n* Bangladesh commits to strengthen and enforce comprehensive anti-corruption laws.\n\n* The United States shall work through its U.S. institutions such as the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), if eligible, to consider supporting investment financing in critical sectors in Bangladesh in collaboration with U.S. private sector partners, consistent with applicable law.\n\n* Finally, the United States and Bangladesh take note of recent and forthcoming commercial deals in the areas of agriculture, energy, and technology:\n\n* Procurement of aircraft.\n\n* Purchases of approximately $3.5 billion of U.S. agriculture products, including wheat, soy, cotton, and corn.\n\n* Purchases of energy products, with an estimated value of $15 billion over 15 years.\n\n* The United States and Bangladesh, consistent with their respective internal procedures, will promptly finalize the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade, and undertake domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into force.",

    "title": "Allegations of Controversial Power-Sector Decisions to trouble an Elected Government",
    "body": "Allegations of Controversial Power-Sector Decisions to trouble an Elected Government Staff Correspondent, Dhaka (Monday, February 9, 2026)\n\nThe Bangladesh Independent Power Producers’ Association (BIPPA) has alleged that controversial decisions regarding private power generation have been taken with the intention of putting the upcoming elected government in trouble.\n\nThe allegations were made at a press conference held on Monday at Hotel Sonargaon in the capital.\n\nBIPPA claimed that ahead of the election, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) artificially inflated electricity demand and increased the amount of penalties imposed on private power producers. As a result, both the current interim government and the forthcoming elected government may face an unstable situation in the power and energy sector.\n\nBIPPA also warned that it would go to court if the decision to increase penalties is not withdrawn.\n\nThe situation titled “Discriminatory Treatment in the Power Sector, Contract Violations, and Crisis of Investor Confidence” was presented by former BIPPA president Imran Karim. BIPPA President K M Rezaul Hasanat responded to questions from journalists.\n\nIt was stated that domestic private power producers were owed Tk 9,000 crore by BPDB earlier. After the interim government took office, arrears increased by another Tk 5,000 crore, bringing the total outstanding dues to Tk 14,000 crore. Depending on the company, bills have remained unpaid for eight to ten months. Unless at least 60 percent of these dues are cleared, power generation will be disrupted during the upcoming Ramadan and the summer season.\n\nIn response to journalists’ questions, BIPPA President said that without payment of outstanding dues, it would be impossible to import fuel oil, and power plants would not be able to operate. He alleged that the interim government is not leaving the power sector in a stable condition for the next elected government. Penalties have been imposed on private power producers before the election, which will put pressure on the future elected government.\n\nImran Karim said that domestic entrepreneurs are being subjected to discriminatory treatment, as facilities provided to foreign companies are not being extended to local firms. According to the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), if BPDB fails to pay bills within the stipulated time, power plants have the legal right to suspend electricity supply. Under Clause 13.2(j) of the contract, BPDB’s right to receive electricity may also be suspended in such cases. However, considering national interest, domestic power producers have never fully stopped electricity supply. Despite huge arrears, they have continued supplying electricity to the national grid by borrowing from banks to the best of their ability.\n\nHe further alleged that when power plants were forced to limit production due to financial constraints arising from unpaid bills, the National Load Dispatch Centre showed demand inconsistent with actual requirements and increased compensatory penalties. These penalties were imposed by citing inadequate supply in a manner that allows BPDB’s outstanding dues to appear lower on paper. In some cases, the penalty amounts have already been deducted from outstanding bills, while the deduction process is ongoing for several other companies.\n\nAccording to power producers, the root cause of these so-called penalties is BPDB’s prolonged failure to pay bills, the responsibility for which is being unfairly shifted onto them.\n\nBIPPA expressed concern that if the outstanding dues crisis persists, it could create severe instability in the power and energy sector. This may seriously hamper electricity generation, fuel imports, and future investment.\n\nIn seeking redress, applications were submitted to the Energy Regulatory Commission, but these were rejected on procedural grounds. Subsequently, power generation companies have filed review petitions, which are currently under consideration.",

    "title": "Offshore Gas Exploration: Are Workers’ Interests Being Excluded from Labour Laws and Regulations?",
    "body": "Offshore Gas Exploration: Are Workers’ Interests Being Excluded from Labour Laws and Regulations? Rafiqul Bashar\n\nA committee is set to recommend excluding workers’ welfare allocations from labour laws and regulations in the draft Production Sharing Contract (PSC). According to relevant sources, the committee formed by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to review the PSC is likely to recommend not including the Workers’ Profit Participation Fund (WPPF) for workers.\n\nWorkers and all other stakeholders have demanded respect for the country’s existing laws. They have stated that taking such a decision without consultation with the Ministry of Labour and without tripartite dialogue would constitute a violation of workers’ rights.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the Workers’ Profit Participation Fund (WPPF) was established by law in 2006. Under this law, every company is required to deposit a portion of its profits into the fund for workers’ welfare. Due to this mandatory provision, both local and multinational companies deposit a specified portion of their profits into the fund every year. The money is used to improve workers’ living standards. Experts believe that all companies should comply with this law to protect workers’ interests. Following the advice of the International Labour Organization (ILO), Bangladesh—along with countries such as Pakistan—has made this fund mandatory through legislation.\n\nThe WPPF does not depend on investment, revenue, or cost recovery. It becomes applicable only when a company declares net profit.\n\nIt has been learned that, in order to sign contracts with foreign companies for offshore gas exploration, discussions are underway to amend labour laws and regulations to exempt this sector from the WPPF in the draft PSC recently prepared by the government.\n\nTo review the draft contract with foreign companies for offshore oil and gas exploration, the Energy and Mineral Resources Division has formed a committee. The chairman of Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited heads this committee. Energy experts and officials from Petrobangla are also members. The committee is expected to submit its report by January 15. It is known that the committee has already held several meetings and discussed various issues.\n\nOne of the committee members, Professor Dr. M. Tamim, Vice Chancellor of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), told Energy Bangla that they are trying to submit the report by January 15. He said whether the WPPF will be included in the PSC is entirely a matter for the National Board of Revenue (NBR), as there is a legal obligation involved. He also mentioned that discussions are ongoing as to whether the committee will recommend granting this exemption to foreign companies. The final decision has not yet been made. He noted that there is a rule requiring 5 percent of profits to be contributed to the WPPF.\n\nThrough this fund, the state receives regular and significant revenue on the one hand, while on the other hand ensuring workers’ welfare, equitable distribution of resources, and social stability.\n\nExperts say that Bangladesh’s draft PSC meets international standards and already offers sufficient incentives to foreign companies. There is no need to remove workers’ benefits from it.\n\nBabul Akter, General Secretary of the Bangladesh Trade Union Confederation, told Energy Bangla that this is a workers’ right. If this benefit is removed by ignoring the country’s laws, it would be against workers’ interests. Stating that it has no connection with investment, he said that many multinational companies operate in the country and all of them provide profit shares to workers in accordance with the law. Granting exemptions to one or two companies or to a specific sector would require extending the same benefit to all, which would reduce government revenue. A large section of workers would be deprived of their rights, and it would damage the country’s international reputation, he added.\n\nAmong the incentives proposed for foreign companies in the draft PSC are exemptions from corporate tax and import duties.\n\nInvestment-Friendly PSC Structure:\n\nFull cost recovery: Contractors can recover all exploration, development, and operational costs related to gas production from the initial production phase.\n\nTax benefits: Corporate income tax of contractors is paid by the government. No other corporate entity enjoys this benefit.\n\nDuty- and tax-free imports: All machinery, equipment, and materials used in petroleum operations can be imported duty- and tax-free, reducing initial capital expenditure.\n\nSources in the energy division have stated that the WPPF is not a PSC issue; it is an existing law of the country, and PSCs will be executed in compliance with the law.\n\nDespite winning maritime boundary disputes in 2012, Bangladesh has not yet been able to begin offshore oil and gas exploration. Domestic indecision and various international events are responsible for this delay.\n\nExperts note that although global energy prices were low during the COVID-19 period, investment remained stagnant. After the pandemic, rising global energy prices failed to attract international oil and gas companies. Previously, seven companies had purchased bid documents, but none submitted bids.\n\nMost multinational companies operating in Bangladesh comply with WPPF provisions. However, some institutions have attempted to evade the law and transfer their entire profits abroad, depriving the government of legitimate revenue and workers of their rightful benefits.\n\nThe Real Reasons for IOC Disinterest Are Geological and Commercial:\n\nIndustry analysis shows that international oil companies’ (IOCs) lack of interest in Bangladesh’s offshore blocks is not related to the WPPF.\n\nGeological risk and limited data: Bangladesh’s offshore area remains a frontier basin with limited modern seismic data. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional seismic surveys are extremely expensive, reducing interest in high-risk investments. Government-sponsored multi-client seismic initiatives are therefore crucial and timely.\n\nGlobal capital competition: IOCs choose regions with proven reserves, lower risk, or very high return potential due to limited capital availability. Bangladesh must compete in this global market.\n\nRisk–return balance: Although positive reforms such as linking gas prices to Brent crude have been introduced in the PSC, some investors may still perceive lower risk-adjusted returns compared to other regions.\n\nThe primary reason for the lack of foreign companies in offshore gas exploration is not the obligation to share profits for workers’ welfare. This is a post-profit, socially responsible mechanism that ensures national revenue, workers’ welfare, and economic inclusion without imposing additional burdens on investment or operations.\n\nThe real challenges are the inherently high risks of offshore exploration, global capital competition, and the lack of adequate data.\n\nUnder the WPPF, 10 percent of the fund must be allocated to the government’s Workers’ Welfare Fund, strengthening national social safety systems. Another 10 percent goes to the Employees’ Welfare Fund, helping motivate workers and maintain industrial peace. The remaining 80 percent is distributed among employees, of which 30 percent is collected as income tax and deposited directly into the state treasury.\n\nAccording to International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, Bangladesh is obligated to protect various workers’ rights. It was under this obligation that the government enacted labour laws and established the WPPF. Withdrawing from this framework could expose the country to criticism from international human rights organizations, observers warn.\n\nTo ensure the welfare of workers in both formal and informal sectors, the Bangladesh Workers’ Welfare Foundation Act, 2006 (Act No. 25 of 2006) was enacted and came into effect on October 1, 2006. This law is a modern version of the Companies’ Profit (Workers’ Participation) Act of 1968. However, due to the absence of specific procedures and enforcement mechanisms, the law has not been fully implemented in practice.",

To support this initiative, the Ministry of Finance has allocated Tk 100 crore.\n\nFisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhter said the move will help reduce production costs.\n\nAlthough electricity prices in agriculture are lower and already include subsidies, the fisheries sector—despite being a sub-sector of agriculture—has had to pay electricity bills at higher commercial rates. In agriculture, the average electricity price per unit is Tk 6.10, along with a 20 percent rebate. In contrast, the fisheries sector pays Tk 13.01 per unit.\n\nFrom now on, industries producing animal and poultry feed, fish feed, poultry farming, and dairy processing industries—such as milk pasteurization, powdered milk, ice cream, condensed milk, sweets, cheese, ghee, butter, chocolate, yogurt, and similar products—will also receive the 20 percent rebate. This means a subsidy of approximately Tk 2.60 per unit of electricity.\n\nAdviser Farida Akhter said the measure will lower production costs and remove the disparity that existed with the agriculture sector. Although fisheries is a sub-sector of agriculture, it previously did not receive these benefits.\n\nShe also noted that the allocated funds will be provided directly to the Power Division through the Finance Division.\n\nCurrently, a 20 percent electricity rebate is being provided to 16 sectors.",

    "body": "Instructions Given to Take Legal Action LPG: Artificial Shortage Created Following Advance News of Price Hike Staff Correspondent, Dhaka (Sunday, 4 January 2025)\n\nThe Energy and Mineral Resources Division has stated that there is an adequate stock of LPG gas in the country. However, local retail sellers have created an artificial shortage in the market following advance news of a possible price hike.\n\nAccording to a press release issued after a meeting at the Energy and Mineral Resources Division on Sunday, the administration has been instructed to take legal action against those responsible for creating the artificial crisis.\n\nRepresentatives of the LPG Owners’ Association and LPG operators were present at the meeting, which was chaired by the Energy Secretary.\n\nDuring the meeting, leaders of the LPG Association and importers stated that retail sellers created the shortage after learning that the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) might increase the price of LPG cylinders this month.\n\nOn Sunday, BERC increased the price of a 12-kg LPG cylinder from Tk 1,253 to Tk 1,306.\n\nIt was also reported that LPG imports amounted to 105,000 metric tons in November 2025, while imports in December stood at 127,000 metric tons. Despite higher imports, there is no logical reason for a reduction in LPG supply in the market.\n\nThe press release further noted that initiatives have been taken to discuss and resolve several demands of the association, including simplification of letters of credit (LCs) and reduction of VAT.\n\nTo normalize the situation, requests have been made—through the Cabinet Division and the Ministry of Home Affairs—to take measures for conducting mobile courts by district and upazila administrations.\n\nIt was also stated that private entrepreneurs import nearly 98 percent of the country’s LPG demand.\n\nOut of 32 licensed companies, 15 import LPG. From January to December 2025, these 15 companies imported 1,258,152 metric tons of LNG (as stated in the report).",

    "body": "Oil jumps 2% as Trump’s Venezuela blockade stokes uncertainty LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters)\n\nOil prices rallied more than 2% on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a complete blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, raising geopolitical tensions at a time of concerns over demand.\n\nBrent crude futures were up $1.41, or 2.4%, at $60.33 a barrel at 1018 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.42, or 2.6%, to $56.69 a barrel.\n\nOil prices settled near five-year lows in the previous session on progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks, as a deal may see Western sanctions on Moscow eased, freeing up supply even as the market grapples with fragile global demand.\n\nTrump on Tuesday ordered a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, adding that he now regarded the nation’s rulers as a foreign terrorist organisation.\n\n“Russian risks are well telegraphed, but there are clear risks to the Venezuelan oil supply,” ING analyst Warren Patterson said.\n\nTrump’s comments came a week after the U.S. seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nIt is unclear how many tankers will be affected and how the U.S. will impose the blockade against the sanctioned vessels, and whether Trump will turn to the Coast Guard to interdict vessels as he did last week. In recent months, the U.S. has moved warships into the region.\n\nWhile many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country’s oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned. Tankers chartered by Chevron (CVX.N) are also carrying Venezuelan crude to the U.S. under an authorisation previously granted by Washington.\n\n“Venezuelan oil production accounts for around 1% of global output, but supplies are concentrated among a small group of buyers, mainly Chinese teapot refiners, the U.S., and Cuba,” said Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Kpler.\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports.\n\nA large drop in U.S. inventories also supported prices.\n\nCrude stocks fell by 9.3 million barrels last week, market sources said, citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. The fall, if confirmed by Energy Information Administration data later on Wednesday, is much higher than the 1.1 million-barrel drop analysts polled by Reuters had predicted.",

    "body": "AI Boom To Fuel Natural Gas Demand In Coming Years, Report Says\n\nA spike in power usage from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers could significantly boost natural gas demand in the second half of the decade, analysts at investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said in a report on Tuesday.\n\nAs much as 8.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas could be required additionally to match the rise in demand, the report added.\n\nWHY IT’S IMPORTANT\n\nU.S. power and technology companies have expressed concerns that the country’s electrical systems are not expanding fast enough to meet the rapidly growing power needs of technology such as Generative AI, prompting data center businesses to sometimes bypass utilities and strike deals directly with power producers or build their own supply.\n\nThe uptick in overall demand has added to a nationwide queue of requests for power generation and energy storage projects to connect to the grid, which swelled to 2,600 gigawatts in 2023 from 2,000 gigawatts in 2022, according to the latest data from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nAccording to the report, natural gas prices could average $4 per million British thermal units during the second half of the decade.\n\nNatural gas prices touched a three-and-a-half-year low in February to $1.61 per mmbtu largely due to mild winter weather, forcing many producers to curtail their production.\n\nThe analysts expect pipeline operators such as Kinder Morgan, Williams and Energy Transfer to be in the best position to take advantage of the growing gas demand, while gas producers such EQT and Chesapeake Energy would also benefit.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nThe report estimates current power demand from data centers at 11 gigawatts (GW), which, in the base case, is expected to grow to 42 GW by 2030.\n\nThe report added that, at its base case, around 2.7 bcfd of incremental natural gas would be required by 2030.\n\nSource: Reuters",

    "title": "The Current Oil Price Rally Is Reaching Its Limits",
    "body": "The Current Oil Price Rally Is Reaching Its Limits Nick Cunningham\n\nOil prices have climbed by about 50 percent from their February lows, topping $40 per barrel. But the rally could be reaching its limits, at least temporarily, as persistent oversupply and the prospect of new shale production caps any potential price increase.\n\nU.S. oil production has steadily lost ground over the past two quarters, with production falling more than a half million barrels per day since hitting a peak at nearly 9.7 million barrels per day (mb/d) in April 2015. American oil companies have gutted their budgets and have put off drilling plans, with many projecting absolute declines in 2016.\n\nThat has sparked a renewed sense of optimism among oil traders. Moreover, supply outages in places like Iraq and Nigeria have also knocked at least a quarter of a million barrels per day offline, an unexpected disruption that put upward pressure on prices in March. Geopolitical unrest still has the ability to influence prices, even while the world is awash in oil. More oil bulls are piling on in anticipation of the April OPEC meeting, on an unfounded belief that the production freeze may actually have any material impact on global oil supplies.\n\nBut while oil traders have found some reasons to believe that oil prices are rising, there are just as many, if not more, data points to backup bearish sentiment. Storage levels in the U.S. continue to set records, hitting 523 million barrels for the week ending on March 11. Until inventories start to deplete in a significant way, oil prices will face a lot of resistance trying to break above $40 per barrel. Iran also continues to add production, albeit at a slower-than-expected rate.\n\nIn fact, the rally to $40 was largely driven by speculation. As short bets peaked and started to unwind, traders closed out positions at a rapid clip, helping to push prices up by $12 to $13 per barrel in less than two months. The trend continued last week as hedge funds and other major money managers increased their net-long positions on crude by another 17 percent. Short positions are now at their lowest levels since last June.\n\nBut now, with oil traders taking the most bullish positions in months while the fundamentals still have not shifted in a correspondingly significant fashion, traders have set up the conditions where oil prices could snap back to the downside. Once it becomes clear that OPEC won’t come to the rescue, and traders have taken bullish bets to unwarranted levels, prices could fall back to the mid-$30s.\n\nIt isn’t just a speculator’s game, however. The physical market could change as well with oil prices as high as they are – shale drilling could comeback with oil prices at $40 per barrel and above. Some areas of North Dakota have breakeven prices at around $20 to $25 per barrel. Drilling for oil in shale is already a “short-cycle” event – a well can take weeks or months to be completed, whereas an offshore project can take several years.\n\nOn top of the quick lead times, U.S. shale companies are also sitting on thousands of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs). Over the past year, companies did not want to complete their wells and sell their output into a depressed market and/or they needed to save cash in the short-run so decided to defer well completions.\n\nThat means a wave of production, the extent of which is unclear, could come back online when oil prices prove enticing enough. Reuters cited a Wood Mackenzie estimate that found that the backlog of DUCs has already begun to decline, falling by about one-third over the past six months. In the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford, more than 600 wells sit on the sideline awaiting completion, which could lead to the production of an additional 100,000 to 300,000 barrels per day. The backlog of DUCs should be worked through this year and next, returning to normal by the end of 2017.\n\n“If the number of DUCs brought online is surprising to the upside, that means U.S. production won’t decline as quickly as people expect,” Michael Wittner, global head of oil research at Societe Generale, told Reuters. “More output is bearish.” Companies could even be forced to complete more wells in a rush to meet debt payments.\n\nNeil Atkinson, head of the oil market division at the International Energy Agency (IEA), largely agrees with the potential shale restart. “If prices keep rising, we could find that because of the cost cutting and the technology improvements that some of this marginal production is switched back on,” he said in a March 18 interview with Fuelfix. “But how long does it take to reassemble crews, get the labor, the equipment and all the rest of it? This is what we don’t know.”\n\nBaker Hughes reported that the oil rig count actually turned positive last week, rising by one to 387 (the overall rig count declined by four to hit 476, due to the loss of five natural gas rigs). Obviously, one data point does not prove a trend, but the dramatic declines in rig counts in 2016 have slowed and basically come to a halt in March. It is too early to tell, but drillers could begin to add more rigs if oil prices rise above various breakeven points. That is not good news for oil prices.",

The protest was suspended after assurances from the General Manager of the Cooperative. Law enforcement personnel, including police and Ansar members, were deployed to maintain order.\n\nAround two hundred auto-rickshaw drivers from Hayat Mor, Debinagar, Shajahanpur, Sundarpur, Charbaghdanga, and Islampur areas of Sadar Upazila participated in the protest in front of the Chapainawabganj Rural Electrification Cooperative office.\n\nProtesters stated that they had long been paying electricity bills at the residential rate, but the sudden shift to commercial billing has nearly doubled their costs. They said the additional financial burden was unbearable, as their modest earnings from driving autos were already insufficient to meet household expenses. The drivers demanded that billing return to the residential rate.\n\nSohel Rana, Asim, and Babu, three auto-rickshaw drivers at the protest, said, “With such high bills, it is impossible to run our vehicles and support our families. We want the previous system restored.”\n\nResponding to the protest, General Manager of the Chapainawabganj Rural Electrification Cooperative, Hawlader Fazlur Rahman, said, “In line with the ministry’s directive, electricity bills for auto-rickshaw drivers have been converted to commercial rates. They have been given some time, discussions have taken place, and charging stations will be converted in the future.”\n\nChapainawabganj District Police’s Additional Superintendent (Crime & Ops), Md. Ekramul Haque, confirmed that auto-rickshaw drivers had besieged the office in protest over the higher bills, but added that police later brought the situation under control.",

    "body": "Subsidy on Electricity Needed for Fisheries and Poultry Sector: Fisheries Adviser Staff Correspondent, Dhaka (Saturday, November 1, 2025)\n\nFisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhter has said that while the agriculture sector receives electricity at subsidized rates, the fisheries and poultry sectors are still being charged at industrial rates. She noted that reducing electricity costs in these sectors would require an annual subsidy of approximately Tk 400 crore. Given the broader interests of boosting production and ensuring food security, a subsidy on electricity for fisheries and poultry is essential.\n\nShe made these remarks as the chief guest at the closing ceremony of “CAB Youth Parliament 2025” organized by the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) at the Mujafar Chowdhury Auditorium of Dhaka University, where students from various universities participated.\n\nThe adviser emphasized that public welfare should take precedence over financial figures, saying, “We cannot hesitate by only looking at the amount of money involved.” She added that discussions have already been held with the Ministry of Finance and other relevant ministries on the issue. Once the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) grants approval, the process will become much easier.\n\nHighlighting inequality in the power sector, she said that although 220 MW of hydropower is produced in Rangamati, local residents do not benefit from it — they still face 5–6 hours of load-shedding daily. Even in the capital, lower-income neighborhoods experience frequent power outages, whereas affluent areas do not. She urged the concerned authorities to address such disparities.\n\nReferring to the upcoming COP30 Conference, the adviser described the “Net Zero Carbon Emission” pledge by developed countries as a deceptive proposal. She said, “Rich nations will not actually reduce carbon emissions; rather, they aim to profit through technology transfers under the guise of emission reduction.” She added that Bangladesh’s contribution to global carbon emissions is negligible, yet it remains one of the worst victims. The adviser asserted that the concept of “Net Zero” is essentially a new corporate strategy for profit-making through technology business.\n\nThe event was presided over by Professor Dr. Shamsul Alam, CAB’s Energy Adviser. A.H.M. Safiquzzaman, President of CAB and former Labour Secretary, attended as the special guest. CAB’s Organizing Secretary Syed Mizanur Rahman and others also spoke at the program.",

It has implemented advanced emission management technologies like Ultra Super Critical boilers to further reduce its carbon footprint and has invested in continuous monitoring and corrective systems. In addition to energy efficiency measures, Adani Power has prioritized water conservation through the adoption of zero liquid discharge system, ensuring minimal impact on local water resources.\n\nSocially, the company has expanded community development programs, emphasizing education, healthcare, and skill-building for communities.

Power generation began on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe first unit of the 525-megawatt power plant, with a capacity of 125 megawatts, has come back online. Initially, the unit will produce 50 megawatts of electricity per day. To keep it operational, the plant will require 800 to 900 metric tons of coal daily.\n\nThe plant’s Chief Engineer, Md. Abu Bakkar Siddique, confirmed the resumption of electricity generation from the first unit.\n\nOn October 19, at around 8:30 p.m., the first unit (125 MW) was shut down due to a burst in the boiler pipe. Earlier, on Thursday (October 16) at 8:35 a.m., the third unit of the power plant had also been shut down. As a result, production at all three units of the 525-megawatt coal-based plant came to a complete halt.\n\nAfter being fully shut down for seven days, the first unit resumed production on Sunday following repairs. The power plant has three units — the first and second units each have a capacity of 125 megawatts, while the third unit can produce 275 megawatts. The second unit has remained closed since November 2020 due to mechanical issues — nearly four years and eleven months.\n\nChief Engineer Md. Abu Bakkar Siddique said that after repairs, the boiler of the first unit was fired at noon on Sunday. Electricity from the first unit started being supplied to the national grid at around 2 p.m. He added that repair work on the third unit is ongoing, and efforts are underway to resume production within the next couple of days.",

    "body": "Ctg-Dhaka fuel transportation via pipeline to begin Saturday BSS\n\nThe country is set to formally launch its first-ever underground pipeline-based fuel transportation facility from Chittagong to Dhaka on Saturday.\n\nWith this landmark initiative, experts have opined that a new horizon is going to be opened in the country’s fuel oil transportation system, which will ultimately result in reducing supply time and carrying cost substantially per annum.\n\nProject Director (PD) Aminul Haque told BSS that fuel transportation through the newly built 242-kilometer covert facility is set to begin after extensive test-trials and successful pre-commissioning.\n\nAt least 260-280 metric tons of diesel will be transported from Chittagong to the Godnail depot in Narayanganj every hour through an environmentally friendly, risk-free, cost-effective, and time-saving pipeline, he said.\n\n“Earlier, we needed more than 48 hours, along with hundreds of oil tankers, to carry such a quantity of fuel through waterways or by road. Now, fuel oil will reach the depot in Narayanganj in 12 hours,” he added.\n\nTest runs of fuel transportation through the newly installed pipeline began in February this year.\n\n“The commercial operation started on a trial basis from the evening of June 22. Through this, the initial activities of operational capacity, experience, and the project handover process have begun,” the PD continued.\n\n“After fixing some technical issues, a total of five crore liters of diesel have been transported through the pipeline without any system loss,” he further said.\n\nFouzul Kabir Khan, adviser to the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, is scheduled to inaugurate this groundbreaking project at the Dispatch Terminal in Patenga at 11am on Saturday.\n\nSecretary of the Energy and Mineral Resources Department Mohammad Saiful Islam and Engineer-in-Chief of the Bangladesh Army Major General Hasan-uz-Zaman will also attend the function.\n\n“The pipeline has an annual transportation capacity of 2.7 million to three million tons of fuel oil, which can be increased to five million tons in the future,” Aminul Haque noted, adding that it can supply up to 350 tons per hour.\n\n“Currently, there is a demand for around 15 lakh to 20 lakh tons of oil in Dhaka,” Haque added.\n\n“It costs around Tk326 crore for transportation every year, while the pipeline will bring down the cost to just Tk90 crore, saving a substantial amount of over Tk230 crore,” he said.\n\n“The project will enhance the country’s energy efficiency and security, and more areas will be brought under the facility gradually,” the PD said.\n\nNotably, fuel oil is now transported from Chittagong to other parts of the country through rail, road and waterways. Over 110 vessels are required to carry fuel through the waterways for different parts of the country every month, according to the sources.\n\nThese traditional methods are associated with huge transportation losses in the name of system loss, pilferage, high cost and supply disruptions during the dry season due to reduced navigability at different points of water routes.\n\nIt prompted the authorities to initiate the project to ensure a smooth energy supply.\n\nThe visions guided the project objectives include the installation of an underground pipeline to transport diesel in an easy, secured and faster way from the main establishments of the petroleum products marketing companies in Chittagong to Comilla and Dhaka, to develop necessary infrastructures for making the fuel transportation and operation system as a modern and sustainable ones, ensuring uninterrupted fuel supply to Comilla, Dhaka, and northern region of the country during adverse weather.\n\n“Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has implemented the project through the 24 Engineering Construction Brigade of the Bangladesh Army,” the PD said.\n\nThe Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) first okayed the project involving around Tk2,861 crore in October 2018. It was supposed to be completed in December 2020, but the project cost has jumped up to around Tk3,699 crore following a delay in the implementation period.\n\nUnder the project, a 241.28-kilometer underground pipeline with a 16-inch diameter from Chittagong to Godnail in Narayanganj, and an 8.290-kilometer pipeline with a 10-inch diameter from Godnail to Fatulla in Narayanganj have been installed.\n\nA total of nine stations have also been developed with the pipelines that crossed through 22 rivers and canals, requiring the acquisition of 286.88 acres of land, the sources said.\n\nA full-fledged modern and automatic depot has also been developed in Mogbari under Barura upazila in Comilla district to facilitate the transportation from Chittagong to Dhaka via Feni, Comilla, Chandpur and Munshiganj districts.",

With Bangladesh’s tax-to-GDP ratio among the lowest in the region and fiscal exposure increasing through SOE liabilities and contingent risks, the document places strong emphasis on improved macro-fiscal forecasting, integrated debt management, and transparent reporting of fiscal risks, according to the release.\n\nThe strategy also emphasizes institutionalization and implementation, noting that the success of the next reform phase will depend on sustained political commitment, stronger coordination across agencies, and continued investment in public sector capacity.\n\nAs Bangladesh moves toward upper-middle-income status, the new PFM Reform Strategy positions public finance not merely as a technical function, but as a cornerstone of economic governance, equity, and public trust, the release added.",

    "body": "Bangladesh suspends backroom natural resource deals, vows ‘transparency’: US report\n\nIn a major development for governance and economic accountability, the United States government’s 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report has spotlighted Bangladesh’s new direction: all future natural resource extraction contracts will be awarded through fully open and transparent procurement processes, a decisive break from the past.\n\nThe report, released Friday, acknowledges that while Bangladesh’s fiscal systems still face structural gaps, the country’s non-political interim government has taken “significant reform steps” with the most impactful being its overhaul of how the nation’s oil, gas, minerals, and other natural wealth are licensed and contracted.\n\nAccording to the US report, the Interim Government has suspended all direct negotiations for natural resource extraction previously initiated by the former administration, many of which lacked public scrutiny or competitive bidding.\n\n“The IG moved to make all procurements for natural resource extraction fully open and transparent,” the report states signaling a watershed moment in Bangladesh’s resource governance.\n\nThis means no more backroom deals. No more opaque licensing. From now on, extraction rights, whether for offshore gas blocks, coal mines, or mineral deposits, must be awarded through public, competitive, and auditable processes.\n\nAccording to the report, budget documents under the previous administration were generally reliable and made publicly available online. They offered information on debt obligations and revenues, including those from natural resources, and provided allocations to state-owned enterprises. However, shortcomings remained such as the failure to release end-of-year reports in a timely manner, incomplete revenue and expenditure data, and limited transparency around public procurement contracts.\n\nThe US report also observed that Bangladesh’s supreme audit institution did not meet international standards of independence, though it released some summarized findings within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nThe report outlined several steps Bangladesh could take to further strengthen fiscal transparency, including:\n\nPublishing end-of-year reports within a reasonable period;\n\n• Preparing budgets in line with internationally accepted principles;\n\n• Breaking down expenditures for executive offices;\n\n• Publishing a fuller picture of revenues and expenditures;\n\n• Ensuring an independent and adequately resourced audit institution;\n\n• Releasing comprehensive audit reports with substantive findings;\n\nand\n\n• Making all natural resource awards and public procurement contracts accessible to the public.\n\nThe US assessment concluded that while gaps remain, the IG’s commitment to transparent procurement in the natural resource sector represents a significant step forward in accountability and governance.",

The institutions will use the electricity they generate and supply any surplus to the national grid. An agreement in this regard was signed on Tuesday at the Power Division office.\n\nUnder this project, the goal is to generate 2,000 to 3,000 megawatts of electricity from Class-A and Class-B educational institutions. The Power Division signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the Health Services Division, the Secondary and Higher Education Division, the Technical and Madrasa Education Division, the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education, and the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs. The secretaries of the respective divisions signed the MoUs.\n\nDr. Faozul Kabir Khan, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, attended the signing ceremony as the chief guest. He said, “The system must be connected to the national grid by February. Strict action will be taken against any distribution company that fails to comply.”\n\nAccording to officials, rooftops of 46,854 Class-B institutions across the country have about 308 square feet of usable space, with the potential to generate 1,451 megawatts of electricity. Tenders have already been invited, and project implementation is expected to begin before December.\n\nDuring the event, it was stated that under the National Rooftop Solar Program, solar systems at Class-B educational and healthcare institutions—including schools, colleges, madrasas, and hospitals—will be installed under the OPEX model. Under this model, institutions will not bear any installation costs, allowing them to save on electricity bills.\n\nPower Division Secretary Farzana Momtaz said tenders are being invited, and investors will be selected based on offering the lowest electricity tariff. The winning bidders will receive financing from commercial banks and other financial institutions. Discussions have been held with commercial banks to provide low-interest loans under green finance schemes.\n\nBangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) Chairman Rezaul Karim and other officials also spoke at the event.",

    "body": "Government Institutions Must Lead the Transition to Renewable Energy: Environment Adviser Staff Correspondent, Dhaka (Saturday, October 18, 2025)\n\nSyeda Rizwana Hasan, Adviser to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Ministry of Water Resources, has said that all government institutions will be brought under renewable energy within the next two to three years. She emphasized that government agencies themselves must take the lead in the country’s transition to renewable energy.\n\nShe made these remarks while speaking as the chief guest at the opening session of the international conference “Road to COP30: How Can National Interests Be Aligned with Global Climate Goals?” held at the BRAC Center Inn in Dhaka. The theme of the conference was “A World Beyond Crisis: Climate Solutions That Work.”\n\nEmphasizing sustainable consumption and production, she called for the adoption of environmentally friendly strategies across all sectors.\n\nThe adviser said that the Department of Environment, with the support of the World Bank, is constructing eco-friendly office buildings in different regions and developing models of energy-efficient, green buildings in collaboration with architects and engineers. She also noted that technology transfer alone would not solve the problem.\n\nRizwana Hasan observed that double-counting in climate finance and weak global governance systems have eroded trust and hindered the flow of adaptation support.\n\nShe stated that Bangladesh must remain proactive in safeguarding its national interests, economic activities, and people’s livelihoods. She praised the government’s updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which reflect the participation and ownership of all relevant ministries and agencies.\n\nThe adviser instructed the Department of Environment to formulate a comprehensive action plan—with specific timelines—for reducing emissions in sectors such as transport, agriculture, and industry.\n\nUnder the newly established Bangladesh Climate Development Partnership (BCDP), four working groups have been formed, with instructions to include representatives from civil society and academia to provide technical and policy support.\n\nReferring to the environmental damage caused by brick kilns, Rizwana Hasan urged the use of alternative construction materials that would reduce carbon emissions, protect agricultural land, and prevent hill cutting. She also suggested using dredged river silt instead of fertile topsoil for brick production.\n\nHighlighting the importance of adaptation measures, she stressed that coastal afforestation, rainwater harvesting, and low-cost salinity removal technologies are essential to enhance the resilience of climate-vulnerable coastal areas. She called on development partners to increase financial and technological assistance to implement local solutions in Bangladesh.\n\nThe discussion was chaired by Khushi Kabir, a member of the Board of Trustees of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). Environmental expert Dr. Ainun Nishat and representatives of development partners were also present.",

    "body": "Bangladesh poised to attract major investments in renewable energy\n\nBangladesh has significant potential to attract large-scale investments in renewable energy and the carbon market, experts told Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus during a high-level meeting at the State Guest House today.\n\nA delegation of development and renewable energy specialists, led by former Norwegian Minister for Development and Environment Erik Solheim, expressed keen interest in investing in small-scale solar projects, carbon trading, and agroforestry. They also discussed the possibility of collaborating on hydroelectricity ventures in Nepal as Bangladesh moves toward reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nWelcoming the initiative, Prof. Yunus emphasized the government’s commitment to facilitating foreign direct investment (FDI) in these emerging sectors.\n\n“These are critical issues for us. Bangladesh seeks substantial investments in renewable energy and the carbon market,” he stated.\n\nHe highlighted that discussions were already underway to import hydroelectricity from Nepal and Bhutan, with the goal of establishing a South Asia energy grid that could deliver power to Bangladesh through a corridor in India.\n\n“This hydroelectric potential in Nepal is a resource waiting to be tapped, but the challenge lies in ensuring effective delivery,” the Chief Adviser noted.\n\nSolheim, also a former UN Under-Secretary-General, pointed out that while Bangladesh lacks vast open spaces for large-scale solar farms, it is well-suited for small-scale solar installations.\n\nProf. Yunus affirmed that the interim government was prioritizing solar energy expansion and had invited Chinese investors to relocate solar panel manufacturing plants to Bangladesh. Several Chinese firms have already explored opportunities to establish factories in the country, aiming to export solar panels to Western markets.\n\nKavin Kumar Kandasamy, CEO of ProClime, a carbon trade and climate investment firm, highlighted Bangladesh’s potential to generate tens of millions of dollars through carbon trading, similar to Sri Lanka’s success in the sector.\n\nProf. Yunus expressed strong interest in carbon market opportunities, stating that revenues from carbon trading could support conservation efforts, particularly in the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest.\n\nDuring the hour-long discussion, the delegation also addressed the Rohingya crisis and the evolving situation in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, where a rebel group now controls much of the region.\n\n–\n\nFrom The Daily Observer",

They also warned that if their demands are not met within a week, they would launch a movement.\n\nLed by the committee’s president, Nur Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad, more than 300 men and women from Patrapara village attended the press conference.\n\nDuring the briefing, villagers stated that continuous land subsidence was occurring due to underground coal extraction. Roads have also deteriorated severely.\n\nThey said that people had initially hoped the coal mine would bring development to the area, but instead, it has brought constant fear and anxiety. Frequent tremors have caused hundreds of houses to crack. Tube wells have dried up, and the roads in Patrapara are in disrepair.\n\nBecause of the artificial tremors caused by mining, it has become difficult for families to live safely in their homes. Panic has spread among all households.\n\nThe villagers demanded immediate repair of cracked houses, restoration of damaged roads, resolution of the water crisis, employment opportunities for educated locals, allocation of land for mosques and graveyards, and the provision of safe drinking water for 1,500 families living in Patrapara village.\n\nThe committee’s general secretary Mamunur Rashid Mamun, Helena Rashid, acting principal of Barapukuria School and College, Abdur Salam, Marjina Akter, Mohammad Hossain, and others were present at the event.",

    "body": "Govt To Restore Tax Incentives For Renewable Energy Power Plants\n\nA restoration action comes soon from the interim government to reinstate the fiscal package for renewable energy-based power plants to attract potential investors.\n\nRenewable energy investors would enjoy tax breaks until 2030 on the income derived from power generation, officials said.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, the now-deposed government withdrew full tax exemptions in this sector and introduced a graduated tax package for ten years.\n\nThe interim government’s move comes following a proposal of Power and Energy Adviser Dr Mohammad Fouzul Kabir Khan to Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed in a letter.\n\nAlready, Dr Salehuddin Ahmed has approved the summary of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) in this regard.\n\nTalking to the FE on Saturday, Power and Energy adviser Mr Khan said the proposal had been made to attract investors as the government is going to float some tenders for a number of renewable-energy projects.\n\n“Investors are making query as to what fiscal incentives we have in Bangladesh,” he added.\n\nAbdur Rahman Khan, NBR chairman, has said they are processing Statutory Regulatory Order or SRO offering the tax breaks once again.\n\nThe interim government, on August 27, 2024, scrapped a total of 42 power-plant projects, including 37 renewable plants, with a combined capacity of around 3,102 megawatts.\n\nThe deals were signed by the past government under the controversial ‘”Speedy Enhancement of Power and Energy Supply (Special Provision) Act 2010″ without bidding as per its quick-fix answer to power shortages. The operation of the act has been suspended by the interim government.\n\nA senior income-tax official says the tax exemption had been valid until June 30, 2024 for investment in renewable energy-based power plants other than coal.\n\nThere are two parts on tax-holiday provisions for investors in renewable energy-based power plants.\n\n“One scheme is for the investors who had started commercial production from renewable energy-based power plants within June 30, 2024. Such investors are entitled to the tax exemption on their income until 2036,” he mentions.\n\nThe existing scheme is for the power investors who would be able to start commercial production by June 2025. They are entitled to a separate 10-year tax package, 100-percent tax exemptions for first five consecutive years, 75-percent breaks for next three consecutive years and 25 per cent for subsequent two years.\n\nThe NBR may have to extend the benefits following instructions of the government high-ups, he adds.\n\nShafiqul Alam, Lead Energy Analyst for Bangladesh at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), says the utility-scale renewable energy investors will certainly benefit from the tax exemption, which may increase investment in the sector.\n\n“However, it is also important to revisit the reasons that delay the utility-scale renewable- energy-project implementation in Bangladesh when other countries implement projects swiftly,” he says.\n\nThe government may lease out public lands to selected renewable-energy projects and cover the transmission costs to quickly ramp up the capacity, he adds.\n\n“This will help the government reduce tariffs of renewable -energy projects through reverse auctions.”\n\nWith reduced tariffs, the average generation cost of power will be within a reasonable limit, too, he adds.\n\nRecently, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) suggested that the government float tenders immediately.\n\nIn the letter to the Finance Adviser, dated October 8, 2024, the Energy Adviser wrote power tariffs would come down if Bangladesh provides incentives to the investors to produce power from clean energy.\n\nThere were fiscal incentives and concessions tagged with conditions which should be continued and reinstated.\n\nThe energy ministry already moved to invite tenders under the Public Procurement Act 2006, Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008.\n\n– FE",

India’s coal use declined for only the third time in five decades due to intense monsoons which increased hydropower and depressed electricity demand.\n\nIn the United States, consumption rose on higher gas prices and after President Donald Trump this year signed an executive order to save coal plants that were likely to be retired and to boost coal production.\n\nDemand in China, which is the world’s largest coal consumer, was largely flat this year, and is expected to fall slightly by 2030 as renewable capacity increases.\n\nHowever, faster electricity demand growth, or slower renewable integration in China, could push global demand above forecasts, the report said.\n\n“China… which consumes 30% more coal than the rest of the world put together, is the main driver of global coal trends,” Sadamori said.",

    "body": "What the Adani allegations highlight about India’s clean energy push\n\nNEW DELHI, Nov 28 (Reuters) – Bribery allegations against Adani Group founder Gautam Adani have highlighted the growing problem India’s renewable energy developers face in finding buyers for the power they generate.\n\nWhile India’s central government wants to shift away from polluting coal-fired generation towards solar and wind, officials say state government-owned power distribution companies responsible for keeping the lights on have dragged their heels over striking renewable purchase deals.\n\nU.S. authorities allege that Indian billionaire Adani conspired to devise a $265 million scheme to bribe Indian state government officials to secure solar power supply deals, after one of his companies was unable to secure buyers for a $6 billion project for several years.\n\nThe Adani Group has denied the charges.\n\nThe conglomerate is not alone in facing increasingly long delays in signing up buyers for the renewable electricity capacity which is now being developed in coal-dependent India – the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\nCoal accounted for 75% of India’s power generation during the year to the end of March, with renewables such as solar and wind, but not including hydro-electricity, making up about 12%.\n\nIndia is still more than 10% short of its much-publicised pledge to add 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power by 2022.\n\nThat has led the federal government to ramp up bidding for renewable projects to meet an ambitious 2030 target of increasing its non-fossil fuel capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW).\n\nIn the five years to March 2028 it plans to tender for more than four-times the capacity of renewable energy projects it commissioned in the preceding five.\n\nTo push states to help meet India’s overall goal, New Delhi in 2022 introduced so-called renewable purchase obligations (RPOs), which mandate that states increase clean energy adoption so that the national share doubles to 43.3% in March 2030.\n\nHonouring these RPOs would require 20 of the 30 provinces monitored to more than double the share of green power in their electricity mix, a February report by government think-tank NITI Aayog showed.\n\nThe problem is that India’s states are unprepared for the rapid rise in renewable generating capacity, lack adequate transmission infrastructure and storage and would rather rely on fossil fuel for supply than risk “intermittent” renewables.\n\nThe challenges were stark in the case of Adani Green (ADNA.NS), opens new tab, India’s largest renewable energy company, which took nearly 3-1/2 years to strike supply deals with buyers for the entire 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power capacity it won in a tender widely publicised as the country’s biggest.\n\nDEMAND POOL\n\nYet setting targets for tenders and issuing contracts is “meaningless” so long as interest from power distribution companies is so low, said R. Srikanth, energy industry adviser and dean at India’s National Institute of Advanced Studies.\n\nAnd the allegations against Adani are likely to result in a further renewables slowdown, as low-cost finance from foreign investors may become more difficult to secure, Srikanth said.\n\nA change in the way some tenders are run has exacerbated delays in the time it takes to complete renewables projects.\n\nThe tender won by Adani Green was the first major contract issued by state-run Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) without a state-guaranteed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).\n\nWhen announced in June 2019, SECI said buyers were guaranteed, but it withdrew the provision from the deal signed a year later.\n\nSECI’s chairman told Reuters last month that a three-fold increase in tendering of renewable projects has left 30 GW of projects for which bidding is complete, but without buyers.\n\n“You can’t expect the states to respond and start signing three times the power supply agreements,” R P Gupta told Reuters in an interview, adding that a “demand pool has to be created” and states had to be “sensitised” to renewables.\n\nBrokerage JM Financial said that it now takes 8 to 10 months to sign power supply deals after a contract is awarded.\n\nBy comparison, companies that were awarded contracts between July 2018 and December 2020 needed around three months to strike supply deals, SECI data showed.\n\n“The sudden surge in bids, large pipeline of projects under construction, mismatch in power demand and bid-pipeline … and constraints in timely execution of projects are leading to delays in signing,” JM Financial said.\n\nRenewable energy projects have also seen cancellations, with about 4%-5% of all tendered projects annulled, and backlogs in transmission infrastructure development, Gupta said.\n\nOne solution, said Rakesh Nath, former chairman of India’s Central Electricity Authority, would be knowing how much power buyers want before projects are bid for.\n\n“Taking buyers into confidence before inviting bids may minimise delays in signing power supply agreements,” he said.\n\nThe Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry.

    "title": "China’s Top Miner to Spend $24 Billion on Coal-to-Oil Project",
    "body": "China’s biggest coal miner announced the construction this week of another massive project to supply feedstock for petrochemicals makers and help clear a prospective surplus of the fossil fuel.\n\nChina Energy Investment Corp. said it will spend 170 billion yuan ($24 billion) to build an integrated plant in the northwestern region of Xinjiang that will turn coal into oil products. As is expected of all such projects, the facility will be powered by renewable energy — although its inputs and outputs will be anything but clean. The first phase is slated to come online in 2027.\n\nThe facility in Hami city is just the latest in a series of coal-to-oil developments greenlit in recent years in the mining hubs of Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. Hami alone has indicated it will approve 300 billion yuan’s worth of such projects in its five-year plan through 2025, which could consume 152 million tons of coal by the end of the decade.\n\nFor all of its rapid deployment of clean energy, China remains by far the world’s largest coal producer and continues to push output to record levels, which hit 4.7 billion tons last year. But the fuel’s main usage in generating electricity has reached a turning point, after being surpassed for the first time by solar and wind installations. Moreover, President Xi Jinping has said consumption needs to start falling from 2026 to meet the nation’s climate goals, which has led coal miners to seek other avenues for their product.\n\nOne problem is that China’s petrochemicals industry is in a funk, the victim of its own breakneck expansion just as consumption has faltered due to a weak economy. Coal-to-oil profits slumped 53% last year, according to the China Petroleum and Chemical Industrial Federation.\n\nAnother is that healthy margins rely on a wide spread between the price of coal, which China has been successful in suppressing, and the price of oil, which has suffered as Chinese imports have slowed. Beijing’s wider efforts to decarbonize the economy continue to weigh heavily on oil processing generally, and Chinese consumption of products like diesel and gasoline may already have peaked.\n\nThe Hami facility, which will be capable of yielding 4 million tons of oil products a year for processing into materials like polyester, is more likely to prosper because CEIC’s scale allows it to mine coal particularly cheaply. It’s liquefaction technology has also been touted as state of the art.\n\nBut the timing nevertheless represents a risk. China’s coal-to-oil capacity rose 24% to 11 million tons in 2023 compared to 2019. That means the new plant will account for a significant chunk of Chinese output at a time when its customers aren’t in great shape and pressure is mounting on industry to reduce rather than add to national carbon emissions.\n\nOn the Wire\n\nChina’s price data for September will probably show CPI inflation stuck below 1% and factory-price deflation deepening, according to Bloomberg Economics. China’s export growth probably slowed while the pace of increase in imports may have stayed barely above zero in September.\n\nChina’s stimulus has given a big lift to sentiment — a key element to turning the economy around, BE said.\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo’s top mining official said the country is courting new investors for its world-class deposits of key metals as it looks to diversify ownership in its industry, which is currently dominated by China.",

    "body": "Glencore and Yancoal have withdrawn a proposal for the largest coal mining project in New South Wales from consideration under federal environmental laws after state planning officials raised concerns about the development’s greenhouse gas emissions. The Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) expansion would have extended the life of two mines in the Hunter region by about 20 years, generating what the state’s Environment Protection Authority described as “significant unabated GHG emissions”.\n\nBoth the NSW and federal governments were required to make a decision about whether the expansion could proceed. Hunter Valley Operations, a Glencore and Yancoal joint venture, withdrew its federal proposal this month after state planners flagged the project’s methane emissions and sought additional information.\n\nMethane, a gas responsible for about half of the global heating experienced, has about 80 times the warming power of CO2 in the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere.\n\nThe company has indicated it will seek to provide the additional information before resubmitting its plans.\n\nThe project was estimated to cause about 23m tonnes of direct emissions and a further 1.2bn tonnes of indirect emissions once the coal was sold and burned.\n\nCarmel Flint, national coordinator at the Lock the Gate Alliance, commended the action taken by the state planning department.\n\n“This is significant because it’s the first time, that we’re aware of, that a government has asked a company to reconsider its plans because of the emissions,” Flint said.\n\n“It’s very positive to see a government finally applying climate targets to the coal-mining sector in this way.”\n\nIn July, the NSW planning department wrote to HVO about the state’s legislated climate targets and projections that showed NSW was not on track to meet a 50% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 or a 70% reduction on 2005 levels by 2035. The state has a target to be net zero by 2050.\n\nThe department noted the development would cause high levels of fugitive emissions of methane in the 2040s at a time when greenhouse gas pollution was required to have “ratcheted down significantly” to meet the net zero target.\n\nIn its letter, the department asked HVO to consider both the practical and financial implications of “avoiding all coal extraction” from Mining Domain 1 – the area of the mine site that would be active at that time.\n\n“Pending this review, it may be appropriate to then request and submit an amended application incorporating a revised mine plan,” the letter says.\n\nFlint said the withdrawal of the federal proposal “underscores that this was an ill-conceived project from the outset”.\n\nThe withdrawal means that a legal challenge by the community group Hunter Environment Lobby (HEL) has been discontinued.\n\n“We are delighted that HVO has walked away without a fight, but we know they’ll be back,” HEL’s spokesperson Jan Davis said.\n\n“And when they are, we’ll be waiting for them.”\n\nSteve Phillips from the group Hunter Renewal said communities in the Hunter had been calling for a “region-wide plan for our economy and our landscape post-coal for years”.\n\n“And this is becoming more and more urgent but has still not been done,” he said.\n\n“The withdrawal today is a reminder the world is shifting away from coal because it is damaging our climate and support is needed for communities and workers to prepare for these structural changes.”\n\nHVO’s general manager, Dave Foster, said the company was planning to continue with the project.\n\n“We are undertaking additional modelling and mine planning to provide this information,” he said.\n\nFoster said the company had withdrawn its federal application “until we can supply this information and consider any impact on the referrals under the EPBC [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation] Act”.\n\nHe said HVO would also seek a short-term extension from the NSW government to allow ongoing mining within the currently approved mine area.",

    "body": "Even after 10 years, is the AL on to a winner?\n\nFor an election year, the political arena in Bangladesh has been remarkably stable, almost quiet so far in 2018. Seasoned observers, over the years used to lamenting the almost inevitable election year troubles (violence, strikes, political deadlocks) and the attendant ill-effects on the economy, our image on the international stage, and above all the daily lives of citizens, would agree. On the surface, it may lend the impression of having matured as a democracy, and learning not to let the political rivalry between the country's two main factions overwhelm and disrupt the lives of ordinary citizens.\n\nThe reality however is almost the exact opposite, and as this election year progresses, it becomes more and more apparent. There is nothing more vital to democracy than a vibrant and imaginative opposition, that is able to challenge the government and keep it on its toes. Take them out of the equation, and what the government in its complacency may regard as supremacy is actually the road to atrophy. A non-intrusive, stable polity - such as the one we seem to have stumbled upon in this election year - can also be forged by sucking the life out of democracy, and the surest way to to do that is by emasculating one side, usually the opposition.\n\nFar from an intense political rivalry engendering a highly competitive contest to sway voters, this year what we are presented with is a lopsided picture where one side led by the Awami League is at the peak of its powers, about to complete an unprecedented ten consecutive years in power, while the other more symbolised than led anymore by the BNP is mired in a historic trough. In the unfeasibly zero-sum game that politics in Bangladesh has always been, each of these ten years has seen the former's grip on power grow tighter, while the latter has drifted further and further from the corridors of influence.\n\nNowadays we see the AL almost toy with the BNP, who are mostly found on the run or airing complaints that unfortunately fall on deaf ears. Of course the AL's methods in acquiring this unprecedented advantage have been more egregious than anything witnessed before on the part of a ruling party. Quite early on, even before a second term was secured under controversial circumstances in 2014, it was noted that the opposition was being repressed in ways, and to an extent never witnessed before in independent Bangladesh, including the military regimes.\n\nRanging from sandtrucks being placed outside the gates of the opposition leader's residence to stop her from attending a political rally to the indiscriminate filing of cases implicating BNP leaders and activists through the use innovative legal concepts such as 'command responsibility' to the defenestration of constitutional bodies of enormous import such as the Election Commission, their tactics have frequently managed to leave the public stunned, if not appalled, at their sheer brazenness. Over the years, it has all been recorded faithfully in these and other pages. How it has served to severely compromise the state's administrative and judicial functions will not bother the Awami League much, caught up as they are in the throes of the powerplay in politics, but Bangladesh will be left bleeding from the fallout long after even the Awami League are gone, as one day they will be.\n\nIt's just unlikely that the BNP, in their present bedraggled state, will be the ones unseating them. Or even troubling them much, at least in the foreseeable future. It is this gradually dawning realization that has reduced the election year we are in to such an anti-climax. Just like 2013, a spate of city corporation elections have fallen due before the main event. Five in particular - Khulna, Gazipur, Rajshahi, Sylhet and Barisal - just like 2013. Back then of course, it was the main event that happened to fizzle out, after the appetizers foretold a titanic battle for supremacy in the hearts and minds of the electorate. With the odds seemingly stacked against them, the opposition's candidates stormed to resounding victories in all 5 municipalities.\n\nThis year, with two out of the five already in the government's bag, and the remaining three set to be held this coming week (a sort of 'Super Monday', June 30), the growing impression one gets around each is that of a rehearsal. More specifically, of the ruling party putting what may well go down in history as its coup de grace, through the paces, before the grand premiere at the much more consequential parliamentary polls set for the end of the year: ladies and gentlemen, say hello to the 'managed' or 'controlled' election. If ever there was a a Holy Grail in electoral politics, this has to be it. Alternatively, you may hear it referred to as 'the Khulna model', after the first of the five city corporation elections held this year, following which most people started catching on.\n\nGenesis of a ruse\n\nDhaka Courier however has recorded the evolution of this model since at least as far back as the Dhaka North, Dhaka South and Chittagong municipal elections held in April 2015, when an exciting few weeks of electioneering (amplified no doubt by the 90-plus days of the opposition's violent blockade programme that preceded it, but also some novel candidates, the electorate profiles drawn from the country's two leading cities, and the genuine feeling that the contests were too close to call) in the end yielded the dampest of squibs: riled by reports of their polling agents being outnumbered at most centres, being beaten up, in some cases arrested (leading to others not even showing up) while in others absent altogether, the BNP threw in the towel before mid-day. We viewed it as a more 'sophisticated' or advanced variant of the 'polling booth capture' that is known to occur frequently during elections in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe day was also notable for the huge number of activists of AL and its front organisations swarming the streets, recreating an atmosphere of the usual field level politics in this part of the world, which of course is not the point on Election Day itself. The prospect of encountering Chhatra League in their present manifestation can be intimidating to a lot of people, even supporters of parent organisation AL. That is why there are restrictions on a party or candidate's workers gathering around polling centres, for example, during voting hours. Some of the BNP polling agents who got arrested or beaten up by police were turned over to the authorities by AL, Chhatra League or Juba League activists. Thus by ensuring that they not only dominate the streets, but are also seen to dominate the streets, they may have the effect of also discouraging their opposing polling agents from turning up, fearing arrest mostly, or getting manhandled.\n\nIn absence of agents, it is easier to commit many electoral offences, including ballot box stuffing, fake voting and inflating the vote count in absence of polling agents. For example, the EWG observers have found evidence of inflating the vote count in two centres in favour of a candidate in Gazipur, according to Shujan.\n\n\"We have come to realise that a huge number of police, RAB and BGB personnel were deployed only to help the ruling party secure victory without people's participation,\" Moudud Ahmed, vice president of the BNP, told journalists in the immediate aftermath of the boycott.\n\nThe blatantly partisan role of the law enforcers is held up by Dr Badiul Alam Majumdar, secretary of Shujan, or Citizens for Good Governance, a civil society platform that has long involved itself in trying to clean up politics in the country, as one of the defining features of the Khulna model, or controlled elections.\n\nAddressing a press conference in the wake of the Gazipur mayor election held last month, Shujan held up four essential characteristics of controlled elections, noting that in both Khulna and Gazipur, the elections were held removing the main opposition's activists and workers from the field with help of law enforcers, in the process obstructing or intimidating polling agents of the BNP candidate from taking up the assignments they had, use of 'muscle power' during the polls in favour of the ruling party candidate, and perhaps most glaringly, inaction by the EC.\n\nSome of the features become identifiable during the campaign period itself. The sudden spike in arrests of BNP activists in Sylhet ahead of the polling day on July 30 can really only mean one thing. The rather elaborately wrought fix is in.\n\nGiven their almost complete lack of preparation for tackling something like this, you can hardly blame some of their leaders for becoming distraught, and acting like beaten men.\n\nSmelling the coffee\n\nSenior leader Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury this week urged their party leaders and activists to put up a resistance against unfair arrest by law enforcers.\n\n\"I've seen a mass wave in favour of 'sheaf of paddy' in Sylhet city, but police has started arresting our party men to spoil it. People created resistance there against such arrest by encircling a police station twice,\" he said.Nagorik Odhikar Andolon Forum organised the programme at the Jatiya Press Club.\n\nFormerly commerce minister under the last BNP-led government, Khosru further said, \"Police stations will have to be gherao (surrounded) in every area if opposition leaders and activists continue getting arrested unfairly. I think resistance against such arrest must be put up everywhere.\"\n\nAlso a BNP standing committee member, Khosru said Awami League has taken an 'election project' to grab power again by keeping people out of the election process, reported our sister newsagency UNB.\n\nAs part of the 'project', he said AL are arresting BNP leaders and activists, forcing out polling agents and harassing them and providing Awami League leaders and activists with 'ballots in the dead of night'.\n\nRecognising the emergent BNP leader said their party will also have to take a counter project now to resist unfair arrest. Gherao the Election Commission, its officials and those involved in Awami League's election project.\n\n\"We also need to prepare a list of those police officials involved in Awami League's election project to expose them before people. We must thwart Awami League's project through a strong resistance to ensure a fair election,\" he observed.\n\nThe BNP leader also said law enforcers and different agencies, not Awami League and its candidates, are carrying out electioneering ahead of the elections to local government bodies. Khosru also took the opportunity to criticise the government for the attack on Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman in Kushtia, saying it is a sign that the government is \"headed for a fall\". Although that would sound to be little more than misplaced optimism.\n\nField notes\n\nWith less than a week to go before polling day, a delegation of the BNP went and met with the Chief Election Commissioner K.M. Nurul Huda, requesting army deployment in all three cities. They were promptly turned down. Yet the CEC, if he was truly independent and not the product of yet another elaborate scheme devised by the ruling quarter, would do well to give it some thought, if only to restore people's faith in the process, which has been shot.\n\nIt was yet another instance of inaction by the EC, completely ignoring the extensive powers and authority granted to him (or rather his office) in the constitution, when it comes to arranging elections. In both Gazipur and Khulna, numerous complaints were repeatedly made regarding the violation of electoral code of conduct, harassment of opposition activists by law enforcement agencies, which the EC largely ignored. Although law enforcers have been arresting BNP leaders and activists for quite some time, the EC issued a directive one day before the election in Gazipur not to arrest anyone without warrant, which amounted to \"a doctor showing up after a patient's death\", in the words of Dr Majumder.\n\nUltimately, the government would prefer nothing more than securing a clean sweep of the 5 city corporations, if only to set the record straight from 2013, which hung over their heads in the years that followed even as they rode high on success after success. Yet the universal perception held across all political observers was that those city corporation elections stood out for a long time afterwards as the last legitimate elections held in the country, with no scope for any questions to be raised regarding the integrity of the vote. For their part, the BNP never shied away from reminding AL of this, pointing to the results as a sure sign that the tenth parliamentary election was theirs to lose, or that they were simply more popular. But Sheikh Hasina and her party have endured, and now armed with the Khulna model, look poised to get rid of this blemish from their record.",

    "body": "Syngenta CEO tells Dhaka Courier more investment announcement to come in 2019\n\nWhen Chinese state-run company ChemChina acquired Swiss agrochemical giant Syngenta last year, the $43 billion deal was biggest ever overseas acquisition by a Chinese firm. China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) being China's number one and a Fortune 500 listed chemical company chose to keep its new subsidiary's business name intact as Syngenta. And as the company Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Erik Fyrwald, an American, oversaw the lengthy acquisition procedures. With its crop protection and seed business in Bangladesh, Syngenta International holds 60 per cent stake in Syngenta Bangladesh Limited and the state-run Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) the remaining 40 per cent.\n\nErik Fyrwald was on a three-day visit to Bangladesh recently (August 6-8). He took some time off from his busy schedules to sit with Dhaka Courier one evening. And the tête-à-tête covered a whole range of issues starting from what the multinational's acquisition means for Bangladesh to advancement of frontier science in agro-biotechnology, from making further investment to do more for the predominantly smallholding farmers in Bangladesh.\n\nWith cutting edge farm technologies under its disposal, the world's top agrochemical company expressed its readiness to explore partnerships and knowledge sharing opportunities with suitable partners including Bangladesh. \"Syngenta has the technical expertise in the most advanced agricultural technologies and would be open to explore partnerships and knowledge sharing opportunities,\" Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald told Dhaka Courier. He said Syngenta will make more investment in Bangladesh and announcement will come in this regard in sometime next year.\n\nErik Fyrwald said, Syngenta's goal is to produce safe, wholesome food and feed for consumers, as well as fiber and biofuels for the agricultural industry irrespective of the plant breeding method used. Without advances in modern agricultural practices, people/civil society would be limited in their capacity to produce enough and better quality food and feed for an ever-growing global population, he added. Syngenta operates state-of-the-art research and development facilities - The Innovation Center in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, USA and Syngenta's Beijing Innovation Center (SBIC), a leading global genome editing programme.\n\n\"Genome editing is one of the PBIs (plant breeding innovations) that improves conventional breeding by making intentional, specific and beneficial changes in the plant genome providing the same genetic diversity, which would be available via traditional breeding but in a faster and more directed way,\" explained Erik.\n\nBangladesh is currently at the forefront of developing and releasing the world's first Vitamin-A enriched rice - Golden Rice. In response to a query, Erik said, \"Syngenta has supported the Golden Rice project and is proud to be associated with it and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), which is the lead developer of the project, along with the inventors in a continuing commitment of the project.\" Erik, who also serves as the Chairman of the not-for-profit Syngenta Foundation, added, \"Although Syngenta has a significant interest in seeing the humanitarian benefits from this technology become reality, we have no commercial interest in Golden Rice whatsoever. Golden Rice is an exclusively humanitarian project.\"\n\nResponding to another question regarding Syngenta's plan to set up production plants of agro-chemicals in Bangladesh, the CEO said, \"Syngenta in Bangladesh has made large investments in Seed Processing Plant, Learning and Development Centre, network of crop protection and field research stations, sophisticated R and D Facilities, laboratories and seed production sites.\" Erik, also a former Group Vice President of US agribusiness conglomerate, DuPont, went on to add, \"Our innovation brings new products in the market and combines genetics and chemistry to create new solutions for the farmers in Bangladesh. We will continue to strengthen our capabilities to serve the farmers of Bangladesh. We have a crop protection plant at Chattagram, Seeds Processing Plant and Learning and Development Centre at Bogura, four site offices at Bogura, Jeshore, Gazipur and Chattagram.\"\n\n\"In Bangladesh, we continue to support farmers by bringing the best technology to the market. We will continue delivering grower-centric offers that enables the region's small farmers to grow more efficiently and responsibly.\" Erik Fyrwald said, \"Our high-quality seeds, innovative planting materials, crop protection products help farmers to improve yield, production, quality which help them keep pace with rising demands. For example our GroMore protocol for Rice which is locally called Rupa is popular among farmers in Bangladesh.\" \"The high yielding varieties of BRRI dhan 28, BRRI dhan 29 and BRRI dhan 49 are cultivated by following our GroMore protocol and the average yields of farmers have increased up to 30 percent when compared to conventional farmer practice,\" he added.\n\nErik said that the Syngenta seeds, crop protection products and solutions are available across 84 thousand villages in Bangladesh. \"Our 1100 Field Forces comprising of full time employees, contractual and temporary staff conduct field activities like farm family meetings, individual farm family contact and demonstrations serving 8.5 million farmers per year through various activities.\"\n\nErik Fyrwald joined Syngenta as its CEO in June 2016. He led the company during a time of strategic change and industry consolidation including managing the company through to the successful acquisition of Syngenta by China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina). He holds a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Delaware and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School. Erik said, \"Globally, we aim to profitably grow market share through organic growth and collaborations, and are considering targeted acquisitions. The goal is to strengthen Syngenta's leadership position in crop protection and to become an ambitious number three in seeds.\"\n\nSyngenta CEO said, \"Key drivers for the next phase of growth will be further expansion in emerging markets, the stepping up of digital agriculture offers, and ongoing investment in new technologies to increase crop yields while reducing CO2 emissions and preserving water resources.\" He also added, \"Digital agriculture is enabling innovative growers to run their operations more efficiently, productively and profitably while helping protect their resources including soil, water and biodiversity.\" In addition, farm management systems (FMS) can generate sustainability performance reports for downstream requirements, which are increasingly in demand.\n\nBangladesh's farm community is largely composed of smallholders, poor with very limited financial capacity to afford pricey agro-chemical inputs. In response to a question that how do big multinationals like Syngenta overcomes such challenge, Erik said, \"Syngenta has been operating in Bangladesh since the late 1960s (through our legacy Company former Ciba-Geigy, Novartis). This has been a developing and challenging market in which agriculture is dominating the economy - 70% of the country's rural population largely depends on agriculture. Out of the 15 million farmers here, around 90% are smallholders.\" He identified the main challenges faced by these smallholders as: lack of information, knowledge about modern agriculture, access to quality input, access to market, access to finance among others. \"Through our exclusive retailer network, called Krishitey Syngenta, which was initiated in 2010, we are bringing technology, training and other services to smallholder farmers to help them address these challenges,\" said Erik adding, \"The network has currently 8,500 franchisee shops around the country. In addition to offering Syngenta products, the shops also provide agronomic advices and credit to the growers. By combining agronomic knowledge with the right use of our products, we are helping farmers to create better value for money, especially for smallholder farmers.\" He went on to add, \"Keeping in mind the local needs of farmers we have introduced small packs of liquid (Insecticides, Fungicides and Herbicides) in 50ml, 100ml and 500ml, and solid products in various packs of 3gm, 5gm, 10gm, 30gm,100gm, 500gm, 1000gm and 2000gm each. Our vegetable seeds viz. Tomato, Okra, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Hot Pepper, Long Bean, Coriander etc., are also available in small packs.\"\n\nErik Fyrwald thinks the farmers today are challenged by a continuous reduction in available farm land due to industrialization and river breaching. The best opportunity for them to increase yields is through adoption of technology, said Erik. \"Access to information about modern technology and training on agronomy is important. Our field force and retailers play a vital role to transfer knowledge to farmers as they have close interactions with them. To enable our field force and retailers, Syngenta set up a Learning and Development Centre in 2009 in the Bogura district to train the 1,100 Syngenta field force and 8,500 Krishetey Syngenta retailers across the country on modern agricultural technology. In this way, we help to connect farmers to modern technology and agronomy knowledge. However, the challenge is huge - there are about 15 million farmers here - so we still have a long way to go.\" Through partnerships, and MoU's with Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) and Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) and Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Syngenta has been able to expand its reach to more farmers and improve their productivity, said Erik.",

    "body": "How one of Bangladesh's most loved film-star went from being a reel life hero to an actual hero\n\nSeldom in the context of Bangladesh do we ever get to see a larger-than-life individual whose message reaches out to the masses even after his films stopped exhibiting in theatres. When an actor retires, their movies often remain their sole legacy. But in the case of Ilias Kanchan, Bangladesh's true-blue movie megastar after Nayak Raj Razzak post-1971, his stand for a cause has had a spillover effect for his fans and critics, who supported him even more after he stopped acting in cinemas.\n\nHis rise in cinema, his stardom, the untimely death of his wife Jahanara Kanchan in a road accident and his subsequent fight to ensure road safety - were all discussed in an exclusive interview with Dhaka Courier recently.\n\nBeginning with his humble roots in Karimganj, Kishoreganj to Abdul Ali, a farmer, and Shorufa Khatun, a homemaker, he told DC that he had always yearned for acting ever since his formative years. He affirmed his never-ending gratitude to director Subhash Dutta, who gave him his first break in \"Bashundhara\" and \"Dumurer Phul\" in 1977. Although he was skeptical how the audience would take such a rookie debutante, he was pleasantly surprised when they carried him on their backs in appreciation, and thus a new star was born. Even his harshest critics could not believe that Kanchan's effortless acting was due to his hard work and talent for acting. Many had asked him whether he was a graduate of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy's acting courses and were often in shock when he replied in negative.\n\n\"I feel blessed that people considered me as an icon, despite competing against twelve other contemporary movie stars, including Razzak Shaheb,\" Ilias recollects. He worked hard to hone his acting skills, and was always in fear of losing his popularity. But after all these years, after winning the National Film Award for Best Actor and countless other awards, he seems content to have reached a full circle in cinema.\n\n\"I consider Bashundhara, Beder Meye Josna, Chorom Aghat and Bheja Chokh to be among my finest and most favourite works,\" Ilias said, adding that the feeling of winning his first award is just as exciting as it was like anticipating his first movie's release.\n\nFast forward to October 22, 1993, tragedy had struck. His wife, who Ilias considered his best critic and irreplaceable life partner, died in an unfortunate road accident. \"Losing someone who wants only what is best for you is beyond all emotions,\" he lamented. It hit him so hard that he had soon started contemplating retirement from cinema altogether.\n\nThat was when a journalist and close confidant shared his thoughts about the tragedy. That individual also reminded him that the fans were there to pay their respect to the wife of Ilias Kanchan the superstar. So he should respect their adulation for him, and if possible, do something to prevent such deaths in future, as people die from road accidents. Pondering every possible scenario, he considered doing something to ensure road safety in Bangladesh. And so on December 1, 1993, he established Nirapad Sarak Chai (\"We Demand Safe Road\" or NISHCHA in short), a non-profit voluntary organisation which is working for road safety issues in Bangladesh.\n\nToday NISHCHA is actively working regarding various road safety issues in the country. Its works are dedicated to ensure safe roads all over the country. At present, Nirapad Sharak Chai comprises nearly 15000 members. It has 70 branches across the country. The organization has affiliation with a number of national and international organizations including National Road Safety Council, Ministry of Communication, Government of Bangladesh; BRAC, Accident Research Institute (ARI) of BUET, WHO etc. It undertakes different types of social awareness building programs, provides training, arranges round table discussion programmes, etc.\n\nKanchan's perseverance for road safety has made him an unsung hero, as his social activities were initially not met with the same enthusiasm as his movies. \"We all want safe roads, but nobody ever strategised how this could be attained, even after all these years. Lack of research in this regard is something that has astounded me till now. The concerned people have not paid heed to any of our recommendations, only until recently.\"\n\nHis hard work paid off when he was awarded the Ekushey Padak for his social service by the government of Bangladesh in 2018.\n\nCiting the public transportation sector as \"unplanned and indisciplined\", he recommends strict measures to restore order, and \"change in strategy is a must\", he adds. Citing the example of drivers, he explains that despite being socially shunned lower than security guards, drivers earn more than guards on the contrary. But their rugged outlook takes away the deficiency of their lack of education, with most drivers often not properly schooled. This gives the transport owners leverage and bargaining capacity over the transport workers, capitalising on their \"illiteracy\" and keeping them down for all this time.\n\nIlias also cited a lack of coordination between relevant ministries as the cause of such degradation in the transport sector. For example, he talked about how the labour ministry could very well look after the welfare of the workers, but that has not been the case. The same going for the ministries of health, women and children, social welfare and others, all of whom could have played a pivotal role in improving the sector. \"Why only Road Transport and Bridges, as well as the Home Ministry will look after this sector?\" Ilias points out, demanding a strong central authority which could make a difference.\n\nHe also had scathing observations about the new Road Safety Act, alleging that none of NISHCHA's recommendations were considered to be added to the law. \"\"It should have been Road Transport and Road Safety Act instead of just Road Transport Act,\" he added. He also stated: \"The act describes a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment but doesn't state any minimum penalty.\"\n\nThe Act says that a life sentence will take place only if murder is proven by investigation under act number 302. The general people may be deprived of justice because of this act. Also the 'driver' isn't always the guilty party. Sometimes it's the passenger, sometimes it's the passersby. So the act should change the term 'driver' into 'responsible party.'\"\n\nDespite all the hardship and pain he had to endure in his lifetime, he advised the young generation to ensure on how to achieve their goals. \"Knowing is half the battle, if you do your homework and set a target, it will help you to overcome the impending challenges. Most importantly, you must respect whatever you do in life. Everything you do is done for a reason.\" Coming from a superstar, those are words which truly cannot be ignored.",

    "title": "Interpretation of Life Imprisonment: New Dimension on Sentencing Law in Bangladesh",
    "body": "Recently Appellate Division of Bangladesh has delivered the full review judgment of Ataur Mridha alias Ataur vs the State (Criminal Review Petition no 82 of 2017) with a dissenting opinion from honourable Justice Muhammad Imman Ali interpreting 'life imprisonment' as Imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of convicts natural life. The rest of honourable justices (6) including Chief Justice of Bangladesh agreed that 'Imprisonment for life' be deemed equivalent to imprisonment for 30 years if sections 45 and 53 are read along with sections 55 and 57 of the Penal Code and section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The majority of honourable justices also decided that however, in the case of sentence awarded to the convict for the imprisonment for life till his natural death by the Court, Tribunal or the International Crimes Tribunal under the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act, 1973 (Act XIX of 1973), the convict will not be entitled to get the benefit of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nBy virtue of this historic judgment, Bangladesh has entered in a new dimensional approach of sentencing policy regarding life imprisonment in two parts such as life imprisonment means rigorous imprisonment for 30 years with the application of other legal privileges as remission and commutation of punishment and another part is life imprisonment is deemed imprisonment for life till his natural death. However on Appeal of Ataur Mridha @ Ataur vs the State (Criminal Appeal nos 15-17 of 2010) had been decided on 14 February, 2017 by Appellate Division that \"life imprisonment within the meaning of section 53 read with section 45 of the Penal Code means imprisonment for rest of the life of the convict.\"\n\nLet me describe the short background of this case. The facts of the case in brief are that Druto Bichar Tribunal, Dhaka vide its judgement and Petition order dated 15.10.2003 convicted the petitioner, Ataur Mridha @ Ataur and two others under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to death in Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.34 of 2003. Reference was made to the High Court Division and was registered as Death Reference No.127 of 2003. After hearing the death reference and the criminal appeal along with the jail appeal of the accused, the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 30.10.2007 accepted the reference, dismissed the appeal, thus maintained the conviction, and confirmed the sentence of death of the petitioner and the other two absconding condemned convicts. The accused preferred Leave to Appeal and subsequently filed Appeal and obviously as last stage of the court was filed Review Petition in the Appellate Division.\n\nIn our legal system there is no definition of 'life imprisonment'. Section 45 of the Penal Code defined the word \"life\" that \"The word 'life' denotes the life of a human being, unless the contrary appears from the context.\" Section 57 of the Penal Code-1860 states that \"Fractions of terms of punishment in calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to rigorous imprisonment for thirty years.\" Sections 53 and 55 of the Penal Code, sections 35A, 397 and 401of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1898 are also applicable in dealing punishment in Bangladesh. In this connection the Prison Act 1894, Prison Rule and Jail Code are applicable too in administration of prison. Section 35A of CrPC was firstly added in 1991 inserting that \"where a person is in custody at the time of his conviction and the offence for which he is convicted is not punishable with death or imprisonment for life, the Court may, in passing the sentence of imprisonment, take into consideration the continuous period of his custody immediately preceding his conviction.\" The section 35A of CrPC was amended in 2003 and omitted the words of 'life imprisonment'. By virtue of this development of section 35A of CrPC, the convict of life imprisonment enjoys the benefit of custody of under trial of the case.\n\nBoth the Appeal and Review judgments analyze the various legal issues and connected legal jurisprudence of South Asia as well as the world regarding the sentencing policy and life imprisonment. Interestingly the Penal Code of 1860 is applicable in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. There is no hard and fast definition of life imprisonment in these countries. Section 57 of the Penal Code is exercised in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh for same purpose. But the life imprisonment is meant here in India is 20 years, in Pakistan is 25 years and in Bangladesh is 30 years. More importantly criminal justice system of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh follows section 57 of the Penal Code for life imprisonment calculation too. Getting remission, life imprisonment in India is at least 14 years, in Pakistan is 20 years whereas in Bangladesh is 22 years and 6 months.\n\nIn criminal justice system, sentencing policy and guideline is very important to confirm the punishment. In Bangladesh, there is no provision of hearing on sentence separately but in India sentencing hearing is regarded as vital part of the trial. The proposition of 'rarest of the rare', 'mitigating circumstance' 'crime test' is very unusual in Bangladesh. The Supreme Court of India seriously applies those principles confirming the punishment finally. In India, life imprisonment is not a fixed term of imprisonment. The apex judiciary explained in many cases about the judicial discretion to confirm what extend of term life imprisonment can be served out by the convict. There are available cases on life imprisonment as term of 20, 25, 30, 35 years with remissions and without remissions.\n\nIn India, the power of executive exercising remissions and commutations is day by day going limited and the court is the ultimate authority to confirm what will be conditions on life imprisonment. The same process is followed by the judiciary of Pakistan, USA and UK in sentencing policy. The Appellate Division states that \"Indian Supreme Court has started putting judicial breaks over the exercise of remission powers by the executive by prescribing the length of life imprisonment, for example to 15/20/25/30/35 years before which no remission shall be granted. This approach is in line with age old sentencing without parole concept appeared in American and English sentencing procedure where Judges retain the authority. [per Hasan Foez Siddique, J at P-94]\"\n\nThe Apex Court of Bangladesh considered the existing laws and dimensions of exercising judicial power on life imprisonment in our Sub-Continent and the World. The principles of statutory interpretation dictate that a statute must be construed as a whole. The words which are capable of only one meaning must be given that meaning. The ordinary words must be given ordinary meanings. If the provisions of sections 45, 53, 55, 57 and 65 of the Penal Code, sections 35A, 397, 401 and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and some other provisions of Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, the Prisons Act and Rules framed thereunder are construed as per rules of interpretation it may be observed that the assertion \"imprisonment for life\" means imprisonment for whole of the remaining period of convict's natural life is not final conclusion. [per Hasan Foez Siddique, J at P-107-8]\n\nThe land mark judgment of Ataur Mritha is the basement to shape a new dimension in sentencing guideline on life imprisonment. Honourable Justice Muhammad Imman Ali supported that a life imprisonment convict can enjoy the privileges of remissions, commutation and President Prerogative following the existing laws but life imprisonment is imprisonment till natural death. The majority decision is simply life imprisonment is 30 years as accordance in section 57 of the Penal Code. However, if the Court, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and gravity of the offence, seriousness of the crime and general effect upon public and tranquillity, is of the view that the convict should suffer imprisonment for life till his natural death, the convict shall not be entitled to get the benefit of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [per Hasan Foez Siddique, J] The Appellate Division also stated that the concern court or tribunal must consider the circumstances which are required to be considered for taking such decision are: (1)surroundings of the crimes itself; (2) background of the accused; (3) conduct of the accused; (4) his future dangerousness; (5) motive; (6) manner and (7)magnitude of crime. This seems to be a common penal strategy to cope with dangerous offenders in criminal justice system.\n\nThe interpretation of the life imprisonment and the binding precedent of Apex Court will be a cardinal reinforcement in maintaining sentencing guideline in the heinous crimes, important cases and murder cases awarding death penalty, life imprisonment till natural death of convict and life imprisonment. This decision also suffices another type of punishment in section 53 of the Penal Code. The proposition of mitigating circumstance and gravity of crime on crime test can be applied in punishment policy on sentencing. Life imprisonment till natural death can reduce the death penalty too.\n\nThe Writer is Senior Judicial Magistrate, Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Feni.",

    "title": "Sweet Danger of Sugar: Know the side effects of consuming too much sugar",
    "body": "At this point, it is safe to say that most no longer view food as a means to survive. From social interactions to formal events, foods, including decadent desserts have made their way into every social or even private setting in our lives without us even realizing it. Pastries, ice-cream, soft drinks and so many more have slowly made their way into our diets as a staple and there is far more harm that can come from it than good. If you have a too much craving for sweet foods, it can make things harder for you down the road. Here, we will discuss the dangers of sugar and the side effects of consuming excess sugar.\n\nIdentifying Sugar Sources\n\nIt isn't uncommon for anyone to desire a balance between sweet and savoury in our meals, but the former can fly under the radar if we are not too careful. Tea, coffee, soft drinks, desserts, dairy products and cereal all contain unhealthy amounts of sugar, with soda and energy drinks being the biggest culprits. While it isn't necessarily a bad thing to consume sugar as a whole, it is easy to dwell into the excess territory as the consumption for this nutrient is meant to be the least out of all according to the food pyramid.\n\nThe Benefits of Consuming Sugar\n\nWhen thinking about the right kind of sugar to include for our diets, natural sugar is the most logical option. As sugar is known to be an energy source, natural sugar is not only the primary source of glucose (which is responsible for your body's fuel), but it is also the best kind of sugar for your body to break down. The easier to break down sugar, the more your body metabolises it into energy rather than allowing it to stay in your system.\n\nNot only does the conversion of glucose result in an instant boost of energy, but the nutrient can also be saved for later. This process is known as glycogenesis and it works by creating a glycogen chain that will break down individual glucose units over a certain period of time. However, unnatural sugar does hamper the body's ability to break down the glucose, which converts excess glucose molecules to fat.\n\nWith a boost of energy also comes a boost in cognitive activity. This can be split into two parts - emotional and analytical. Contrary to popular belief, sports isn't the only dopamine inducer - sugar does also contain this feature. Dopamin is a hormone secreted by the brain when in pleasure and there are glands in our body that trigger this secretion via sugar. Natural sugars like cocoa also contain sugars and antioxidants that improve brain function as a whole and can increase alertness.\n\nLastly, natural sugars normally are coupled with other nutrients such as fiber, antioxidants, minerals, vitamins and more. Dairy products, fruits and vegetables are examples of this and prove that the consumption of natural sugar sources benefit the body in more ways than one. This is the reason why many beverages that are considered \"good for the diet\" contain fruits, milk or vegetables.\n\nHealth Risks of Sugar Consumption\n\nEven though natural sugar has a decent amount to offer, going overboard with this delicious nutrient can pose both short and long term problems. Possibly the most obvious out of the lot is the ability to gain weight easily.\n\nHaving an excess of fat is never a good thing and the dangers go far beyond just aesthetics. By consuming a high amount of sugar, your body may develop an immunity to leptin, an extremely vital hormone that indicates when it is time for your body to stop eating. This is possibly one of the main reasons why overweight individuals also have a larger appetite than most.\n\nHigh sugar also means high levels of blood sugar. With that, it comes with artery clots and eventually heart diseases. Many surveys have been conducted to substantiate this, but also have concluded that it only takes one sugary drink to surpass the ideal amount of sugar consumed in a day.\n\nAdditionally, Type 2 diabetes becomes more possible with careless sugar consumption. The surplus of sugar can result in insulin resistance that the blood desperately wants to avoid to stabilize its sugar level. This is hampered by making the pancreas a lot less proficient in dispensing said insulin in the body to moderate blood levels.\n\nWhile these long term hazards are worth being wary of, the relatively immediate side effects are also a cause of concern. Acne outbreaks are not uncommon and high blood sugar leads to a spike in oil production and androgen secretion which are primary causes for acne outbreaks. Interestingly, a survey was conducted on the skin condition of those who reside in rural areas and their acne rates were almost non-existent due to the limited resources for processed food available.\n\nEven if you manage to avoid outbreaks, the overall lack of insulin and general surplus in sugar does affect the skin by adding more wrinkles and catalysing your skin's aging process. Even though this may appear as solely aesthetic, the effects go down to details that even reach the body's chromosomes.\n\nTelomeres are found at the end of chromosomes and serve as protection from the chromosomes from aging: sugar obstructs this safeguard and does in essence allow your body to deteriorate at an accelerated speed. And finally, it is important to heed the warnings of our dentists from a young age. Too much sugar can cause cavities easily and poor dental hygiene will result in gum decay and eventual tooth loss.\n\nOverall, it is quite clear how easily the body can spiral out of control with just an extra serving of sugar that we don't really need. The best thing to do is keep our intake of sugar to a minimum and favor sugar sources that are more natural to reap the benefits of this potent nutrient.\n\nEzra Gideon, UNB and Dhaka Courier Correspondent in Singapore.",

    "title": "US defeat in Afghanistan marks the end of neoliberalism",
    "body": "The past 50 years of Western economics are rooted in imperial exploitation. But if the US’s military can be beaten, it can’t rule global markets\n\nThe neoliberal era, which arrived as the US lost the Vietnam war, has ended with America losing the war in Afghanistan. And the war on terror. And the war on drugs.\n\nImages on Twitter timelines, TV screens and in group chats tell a gruesome story for those who face slaughter and subjugation by the Taliban. Women, Shia people and anyone who collaborated with US and UK forces or with the now-essentially defeated regime face a grim future, as the \"hooligans of the absolute\", as the political thinker Tom Nairn dubbed them, take control of the country once more.\n\nI can't help but think of the Afghans I met in a refugee camp in Belgrade in 2015. One man had been shot in the leg while serving in the national army alongside British troops. He was flown to a hospital in Cardiff, where he spent a year recovering. But he was denied asylum, and sent back to Afghanistan. Knowing Taliban forces would kill him and his family, he had walked all the way to Europe on his gammy leg, with his sister and her children.\n\nWere they turned back at the EU border? Have they been killed? I tried to stay in touch on Facebook, but I've no idea what happened to them.\n\nI can't help but think of the 32,000 Afghan asylum seekers the UK has turned away since 2001, as openDemocracy revealed yesterday. Did Britain's deportation flights deliver them to firing squads?\n\nI can't help but think of my grandmother, who was in her late 80s when the NATO invasion began in 2001. \"Didn't we learn our lesson in the second Afghan war?\" she asked the teenage me, referring to the British invasion in 1878, only a generation before she was born.\n\nI can't help but think of the accounts of the first Anglo-Afghan war, in 1839, when Britain invaded, was kicked out of, and then reinvaded the country as 'revenge' - murdering, raping and starving whole villages as they went, so they could turn this human society into a buffer zone for their Indian colony. This isn't a 20-year history, it's a 200-year history.\n\nI can't help but think about the war on drugs. If, instead of criminalising heroin and driving its central Asian growers into the pockets of the Taliban, we had legalised and regulated it, where would we be?\n\nI can't help but imagine why so many teenage boys and young men who have known nothing but NATO occupation are so desperate to overthrow the government that they will align with foreign fighters and slaughter their neighbours.\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder at the failure of Britain's national press to ask these questions. Twenty years of war, twenty years of supposed nation-building by what started out as the most powerful alliance in human history has been swept aside in a matter of days.\n\nThe neoliberal era is over. And as we see in Kabul today, what comes next isn't inevitably better.\n\nIs neoliberalism really over?\n\nThere has been a bit of debate of late about whether neoliberalism is dying, or changing. Events such as this year's G7 agreeing, in theory at least, to a global minimum corporation tax, encouraged the economic historian Adam Tooze to say that the elite consensus around neoliberalism as an idea is gone.\n\nJust as significantly, as openDemocracy co-founder Anthony Barnett has pointed out, the height of neoliberalism was defined by a denial in elite circles that such a thing existed. \"You might as well debate whether autumn follows summer,\" Tony Blair argued in 2005, against those who wished to discuss the globalisation of Western markets.\n\nThis wasn't an ideology, they'd say, just logic, just the way things are, just reality. These days, even the Financial Times is starting to question whether neoliberalism works - yes, using that word - and the arch think tanks of the ideology have returned to using the term. Their idea isn't common sense anymore - it needs defending.\n\nEconomics journalist Grace Blakeley thinks neoliberalism is alive and well, though. Writing in Tribune in May, she argued: \"The neoliberal state is not a small state, it is a state designed to meet the interests of capital\". COVID bail-outs, she concludes, don't spell the end of neoliberalism. \"States are spending more money because big business and big finance needs to be bailed out - again.\"\n\nThe following month, historian Quinn Slobodian quite rightly pointed out the ideological connections between the new, nationalist Right - the Trumps, Bolsonaros and Brexiters - and the neoliberal Right. The forefathers of neoliberalism were much more racist than we're usually told, and the nativist, new Right is much more closely aligned to big money than it likes to admit.\n\nIf Donald Trump's former chief adviser, Steve Bannon, glorifies Hayek - and he does - isn't he a neoliberal too?\n\nBoth James Meadway, writing for Novara, and openDemocracy's economics editor, Laurie Macfarlane, argue, however, that a shift in the international order points to the replacement of neoliberalism by a system of authoritarian capitalism, typified by the rise of China, but also by Trump's breaking of neoliberal trade agreements.\n\nAnd we can understand the US retreat and defeat in Afghanistan only in this context.\n\nWhat was neoliberalism?\n\nUsually, neoliberalism is described as an ideology - the belief that the state should be rolled back and the market allowed to roam free - developed in the famous think tanks and university economics departments of Anglo-America.\n\nI don't think that's the best way to look at it. Opinion polls in countries around the world consistently show that neoliberal ideas such as privatisation, tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation are deeply unpopular. And yet they have dominated for 40 years. Neoliberalism is an idea, but it wasn't powerful because of its success as an idea.\n\nThe academic William Davies has provided perhaps the most succinct definition, which frames neoliberalism as a sociological process: \"the disenchantment of politics by economics\". This gets to the heart of a lot of what went on - the shifting of decisions from the political sphere to the market: one person, one vote to one dollar - or pound or euro or yuan - one vote. Or perhaps a million dollars.\n\nIf the first half of the 20th century saw women and working-class people win the right to elect national governments, the final quarter saw those running those governments hand power elsewhere, to ensure that most people never really got near it.\n\nBut I prefer to see neoliberalism another way: as an historical and geographical process.\n\nFor centuries, the dominant form of capitalism was colonialism. People who had money realised that one very good way to make more of it was to pay for someone to go somewhere else, and plunder.\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping, invented in medieval northern Italy, allowed businesses to monitor capital, credit, loans and investments. One early adopter was Christopher Columbus, who took a royal accountant on his notorious 1492 voyage.\n\nSoon, Europeans became the world's experts in capital accumulation through colonial violence: hence the genocides of the Americas and Australasia, the East India Company's brutal conquest of South and South East Asia, the murderous Scramble for Africa and the Opium Wars, to give just a smattering of examples. Control of global markets helped produce the industrial revolution, which intensified the process.\n\nEuropean-Americans followed the example with zeal, genociding and conquering the 'wild' west - with the Dakotas, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah incorporated as states in the late-19th century, New Mexico and Arizona in 1912, and Hawaii and Alaska in 1959 - alongside the de-facto colonisation of much of the Pacific (the Philippines were a US colony from 1898-1946, Micronesia was under US administration from 1945 to 1986.)\n\nThis westward expansion of the American empire got into trouble when it hit the Asian mainland, and bumped into Chinese and Russian power - with the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam delivering not just military defeat, but also popular uprisings across the Western world.\n\nUnable to reach into this terrain, but dominating much of the rest of the planet, Western capital had hit a boundary. After a brief flirtation with space travel, it was unsure where to go next. It was no longer simple for capital to colonise somewhere 'new'.\n\nI tend to think of neoliberalism as the response of Western capital and its allied states - and led by US capital and the American state - to that boundary. It was an attempt to create a single global market with the US and, to some extent, western Europe, at its core. It's not a coincidence that it came immediately after the break-up of most of the British empire - in many ways, it was America's attempt to replace it.\n\nUS military defeat first in Iraq, and now in Afghanistan, marks the end of that era.\n\nConsent to govern and humanisation\n\nTwo inventions, both in 1947, helped accelerate the shift away from traditional imperialism by ending the vast asymmetries in violence between colonised and coloniser. Unlike their predecessors, the AK-47 assault rifle and the Toyota Hilux could be fixed in the field when they broke down or jammed, and their widespread distribution provided cheap and accessible means for mass violence. The tools of war were democratised. The power of insurgents grew.\n\nJust as significantly, communications technology had transformed too. The world became more connected than ever, and, as Anthony Barnett described last year, the uprisings of 1968 helped create a sense of global community.\n\nThe violent reality of empire had always been contested in the imperial centres. In May 1840, during the first Opium Wars, William Gladstone wrote in his diary that he lived \"in dread of the judgments of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China\". But the judicious distribution of plunder, patriotism and propaganda had allowed the system to secure sufficient consent to operate.\n\nJust as the plunder had begun to dry up as imperial capital reached its geographical boundaries, so, too, the systems of propaganda started to break down. The significance of the Tet offensive wasn't just the military shift in fortunes. When North Vietnamese forces received the order to \"crack the sky, shake the earth\", they did just that, but not only in the way they imagined.\n\nIn the US, colour television had started to take off, colour photography was already dominating the front pages of the nation's magazines. While European empires had faced disasters in previous decades, their citizens sitting at home had never seen them so vividly.\n\nBut at the same time as America was losing the propaganda war in Vietnam, it was winning the secret war in Indonesia. Two months after the Tet offensive began, US-backed Suharto was sworn in as president of what was then the world's fifth most populous country. It took until 2017 for the scale of the CIA's involvement in murdering a million people to be officially confirmed.\n\nSuharto used US-trained economists to force markets open to American capital, creating what Transparency International would later describe as \"the most corrupt government in modern history\". He remained in power until 1998.\n\nFive years after Suharto's swearing-in, a similar model was used to depose Chile's elected president, Salvador Allende, in a flurry of bomber jets, replacing him with General Pinochet and a shock of US-trained economic advisers - students of the Chicago University professor, Milton Friedman. Pinochet's regime is often seen as the first experiment in neoliberalism.\n\nAs the writer and academic David Wearing has pointed out, an important feature of this system has been a willingness to ally with all kinds of brutal, fundamentalist and authoritarian regimes if they align with the interests of Western capital. As he says, you don't need to conduct a thought experiment to see how the British and US governments would treat the Taliban were they useful to them. You only need to look to the House of Saud.\n\nIn fact, in her seminal book 'The Shock Doctrine', writer and activist Naomi Klein shows that the myth that US capital advanced around the world hand in hand with democracy is a lie. Rather, she explains, it was through the exploitation of crises and administration of violence that countries were forced into the globalised neoliberal economy.\n\nAnother feature of this system is that it responded to the lack of new territory to conquer by focussing on extracting wealth from the Western states it had previously relied upon as its key allies in conquest, through the privatisations that became one of its defining properties.\n\nWhile reductions in government spending were sometimes part of the rhetorical programme, they were less frequently a feature of reality. US government spending has remained roughly the same throughout the neoliberal era. The real process that's taken place in Washington has been a rapid growth in military spending, making up for a fall in other funding.\n\nWhile the US tried to expand its control, European powers, bankrupted by WWII, faced in their empires resistance movements increasingly armed with those AK-47s and Hiluxes and with superior local knowledge. The Europeans feared that ongoing attempts to govern their colonies would lead them to full alignment with the USSR and so retreated from them.\n\nOne consequence of these processes was the formation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960. Where British companies had previously effectively stolen oil from beneath the Middle East, now, domestic autocrats wanted their share. And in 1973, as the Yom Kippur war raged, they revved their engines, and quadrupled the price of oil. Along with the financial turmoil produced by the defeat in Vietnam, these events produced the economic crisis of the 1970s.\n\nRichard Nixon, advised by those Anglo-American economists and think tanks, abandoned the post-war agreements that had held together the social democratic consensus across the West since World War Two, plunged the dollar off the gold standard, and ushered in the new consensus of marketisation, known to its founders as the neoliberal system.\n\nIn the next decade, the Soviet Union would also discover how technology had democratised violence as it met the US-armed Mujahideen in Afghanistan, who ultimately contributed to its downfall. But that's another story.\n\nThe mechanisms for trying to control these former colonies - and for ensuring the continued transfer of wealth from South to North - continued. The World Bank and IMF imposed conditions on loans, known as structural adjustment programmes, which did nothing to alleviate poverty and everything to ensure Western capital got to eat from the table first. Complex corporate-ownership structures were developed. Undercover operations continued, and wars were still waged - particularly against regimes that controlled large supplies of oil.\n\nBut, unlike the days of empire, when the control of colonies by colonisers was clear, even if the mission was sometimes spun as Christian and civilising, the process was always made opaque. The impoverishment of the already poor was somehow always justified as being for their own good, or as part of the natural order of things. As global connectedness expanded, it was harder to murder, torture and plunder in other countries without facing a backlash at home: compare, for example, the limited reaction against Britain's mass-torturing of Mau Mau prisoners in the 1950s and 1960s with the backlash against the human rights abuses committed in the Iraqi prison, Abu Ghraib, by the US in the early 2000s.\n\nThe main difference between the UK's success in the Malayan 'emergency' (1948-1960) and the US's defeat in Vietnam was, arguably, that the UK could get away with using concentration camps.\n\nAs the US embraced its role as the world's primary imperial power, it faced the significant challenge of managing a domestic population more connected to the rest of the world than that of any previous imperial centre. And so it developed a whole thicket of mechanisms for obscuring the processes of plunder that were going on: from shifting control to corporations to handing power to transnational institutions to vast expansions in debt, both internationally and domestically.\n\nAnd one of those mechanisms was the propaganda of liberal interventionism, the idea that Western military intervention was being done for the good of the citizens of wherever was being intervened in.\n\nOf course, you can perfectly reasonably argue that some such interventions were in fact good for the residents of the countries that were bombed, that they were better off without whichever regime was deposed. That's a conversation for another day. But it's hard to argue that humanitarian ideals were the primary motivations for the various bombings at the height of neoliberalism: brutal regimes weren't just tolerated, but actively celebrated, where they were willing for their countries to be subsumed into the Western-dominated global market.\n\nA system built on illusions can't keep reality in a headlock forever. Twenty years ago, fascist groups radicalised by US troops in the Holy Land smashed into the Twin Towers and baited Washington into a 30-year war. While the credit that was crunched in the 2008 financial collapse has largely been re-issued, the sense of shared riches in the 1990s has been replaced in the West by a deep feeling that something is broken. And US defeat in Iraq, and now Afghanistan, only confirms that sense. After all, can you think of a war that the US has won this century?\n\nWe already had signs that neoliberalism was crumbling, as authoritarian and nationalist capitalists have taken control of countries from India to Brazil, and even the former technocrats of market rule swung the state into action as the pandemic arrived.\n\nBut US defeat in Afghanistan is another sign that the neoliberal era is over, because it marks the death - for now - of that attempt to unite the world into a US-led market.\n\nAnd it also tells us something about what will likely replace it. As openDemocracy's international security adviser, Paul Rogers, has pointed out, the Chinese government has much to gain. Earlier this month, the Taliban's political chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, met with Beijing's foreign minister, Wang Yi. The tiny border between the two countries - the Wakhan Corridor - comes at the end of a finger between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, a legacy of 19th-century games between the Russian and British empires.\n\nThis finger, combined with an alliance with a Taliban government, would allow Chinese capital new trade routes into the Middle East and the West. If neoliberalism was about the power of American capital, then there's every chance that what comes next is increased Beijing hegemony, with its system of authoritarian capitalism dominating both East and West.\n\nThere is also every chance to resist.\n\nBut as ever, the people of Afghanistan will continue to be treated as roadkill on someone else's journey.\n\nFrom openDemocracy",

    "body": "He defends deal with China; highlights Dhaka’s interest\n\nForeign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Wednesday defended the government's decision to set up a UAV (drone) manufacturing and assembly plant in Bangladesh with support from China, stressing that it matters little what others may think about the move.\n\n\"If Bangladesh plans to establish a factory or sets up a factory with the support of another country, it will be done in the interest of Bangladesh and based on its own decision. It does not matter who thinks what about Bangladesh's decision,\" he told reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when asked about a recent agreement with China.\n\nHossain posed a counter question, asking, \"Does his opinion carry any importance regarding whatever happens in India or Pakistan?\"\n\nReferring to cooperation with China, the Adviser said such collaboration is already taking place, and if a factory is established through this process, it is not a matter for the Foreign Ministry.\n\nWhen a reporter drew his attention to comments made by the newly appointed US Ambassador to Bangladesh, Brent T. Christensen, both after his arrival and prior to arriving in Dhaka, the Adviser said they have seen that. \"We will take decisions and work in line with our interests.\"\n\nNo Comments on US Diplomat\n\nAs the Jamaat-e-Islami readies for its strongest showing at the polls next month, US diplomats are quietly signalling a willingness to engage with the once-banned party, reports The Washington Post, citing audio recordings it says it obtained.\n\nIn a Dec 1 closed-door discussion with female Bangladeshi journalists, a US diplomat in Dhaka described the country as 'shifted Islamic' and predicted that Jamaat would 'do better than it's ever done before' in the Feb 12 elections, The Washington Post said, citing the audio recording.\n\nWhen his attention was drawn to the report, Adviser Hossain said, \"I won't want to make any comment.\" He said there is nothing to gain through speculation and noted that they will see who wins the election and the elected party will deal with the USA.\n\nDhaka-Beijing Ties\n\nDhaka and Beijing on Tuesday signed a Government-to-Government (G2G) agreement for setting up a UAV manufacturing and assembly plant and technology transfer in an effort to strengthen defence cooperation.\n\nThe deal was signed between Bangladesh Air Force and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation International (CETC) at the Air Force Headquarters in Dhaka Cantonment.\n\nCETC is a massive state-owned conglomerate and leading defense contractor specializing in electronics, software, and information systems.\n\nThe agreement was signed for the establishment of an 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)' manufacturing and assembly factory and the Technology Transfer (TOT) project.\n\nUnder the agreement, Bangladesh Air Force and CETC International will jointly set up a state-of-the-art UAV manufacturing and assembly facility in Bangladesh.\n\nThis includes technology transfer, capacity building, industrial skills development and joint technical cooperation, which will help achieve self-reliance in UAV production in the long term, according to ISPR.\n\nBangladesh Air Force will initially acquire the capability to produce and assemble various types of Medium Altitude Low Endurance (MALE) UAV and Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) UAV. In addition, Bangladesh Air Force will produce its own UAV through this project.\n\nThese UAVs will play a significant role in military activities as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster management, ISPR said.\n\nUS Ambassador Christensen on Wednesday said he is concerned about broader Chinese influence in South Asia, stressing that they have a host of options available to try to help their partner militaries meet their capability needs.\n\n'You know, as I said in my hearing...I am concerned about broader Chinese influence in South Asia. I think the United States government has been very clear about that,\" he said while responding to a question during an interaction with a small group of journalists.\n\n\"And as I committed to my hearing, I will always engage with our friends in the government-be it the interim government or the newly elected government-- to clearly articulate the risks of involvement with the Chinese in certain areas should the Bangladesh government choose to go down that path,\" Ambassador Christensen said.\n\nChina on Thursday reacted to China-related remarks by the US Ambassador to Bangladesh, urging the US side \"to be more aware of its responsibilities, and focus more on actions\" that are \"conducive to Bangladesh's stability\" as well as the development and cooperation in the region.\n\n\"Such remarks by the US Ambassador to Bangladesh are irresponsible and utterly unfounded,\" said the Spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh, refuting China-related remarks by the US Ambassador to Bangladesh.\n\nThe Spokesperson said they confuse right and wrong, and are \"completely out of ulterior motives.\n\nOver the past 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the Spokesperson said Bangladesh and China have always supported each other, treated one another as equals, and engaged in win-win cooperation.\n\n\"The China-Bangladesh cooperation has delivered benefits to and received broad support from the people of both countries. It is conducive to the development and stability in the region,\" said the Spokesperson.\n\nChina said cooperation between Bangladesh and China is a matter between the two countries and their peoples, and brooks no interference or finger-pointing by the US side.",

We will act while maintaining a balance,\" he told reporters when a journalist asked about the possible impact of such an agreement on Bangladesh's relations with Washington.\n\nAdviser Hossain said Bangladesh needs to enhance the capabilities of its armed forces, citing the Air Force as an example.\n\n\"Our aircraft are very old, and many of them are not even in serviceable condition. We will have to make minimum purchases. There is ongoing discussion about where to procure equipment from and how much to acquire from which country,\" he said.\n\nAhead of the formal signing of the agreement with China, media reported said the Ministry of Finance on January 6 approved a project proposal officially titled \"Establishment of Manufacturing Plant and Transfer of Technology (ToT) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).\"\n\nResponding to a question about alliance formation, the Foreign Affairs Adviser said Bangladesh has not joined any alliance in the past one and a half years.\n\n\"Discussions on various groupings will continue. If we see that joining a group serves our interests and helps protect them, we will do so. Otherwise, there is no question of joining,\" he said.",

It is still at the discussion level. It has not been determined yet who will be part of this initiative.

    "body": "Tarique Rahman spent 17 years in self-imposed exile. Now, he is poised to become the prime minister of Bangladesh - and follow in the footsteps of his mother.\n\nThursday's national election seemed to hand Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party a majority, according to local media reports, marking a significant political shift in the South Asian nation of more than 170 million people. The BNP has also claimed victory.\n\nFor Rahman, the turnaround is dramatic.\n\nThe 60-year-old returned from London in December to a country in turmoil. Within days, his mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, died from long illness. In the election, he faced a rising religious conservative party that had gained momentum after a 2024 student-led uprising toppled Zia's longtime rival, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nAnd yet his biggest challenge may still lie ahead.\n\nThe path from the 2024 uprising to Thursday's election has been marked by turmoil. Bangladesh grappled with unrest after a student leader's death, a resurgence of Islamist groups, the fraying of the rule of law, attacks on Hindu minorities and the press, as well as a struggling economy.\n\n\"Rahman has said all the right things, pledging to eliminate corruption and bring the country together. That all sounds well and good. But the BNP has a poor track record from when it was last in power - there was repression and corruption,\" said Michael Kugelman, a Senior Fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council.\n\nSon of a political dynasty\n\nRahman is a key figure in the Zia political dynasty.\n\nHis mother served two five-year terms as prime minister, the last time from 2001 to 2006. His father, Ziaur Rahman, rose from the army to become Bangladesh's sixth president before his assassination in 1981.\n\nHe is married to Zubaida Rahman, a physician and daughter of a former Bangladesh Navy chief.\n\nHis BNP, one of the country's longstanding political forces, alongside Hasina's now-banned Awami League party, has for decades dominated Bangladesh's political landscape. In recent years, the BNP boycotted several elections, including the 2024 vote, citing widespread fraud.\n\nRahman has a controversial past\n\nRahman's political career has been controversial.\n\nTargeted by multiple criminal cases under Hasina's government, he spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London. In 2018, he was sentenced to life in prison in connection with a 2004 grenade attack on Hasina that killed at least 24 people. Hasina narrowly survived the attack. Rahman denied he was involved in the attack and denounced the verdict, along with his party, terming it politically motivated.\n\nRahman left Bangladesh in 2008, officially for medical treatment, after enduring torture while in custody during the military-backed administration that governed from 2006 to 2008, following Zia's failure to peacefully hold a new election and hand over power.\n\nThough he never held office in his mother's governments, Rahman wielded significant influence within the BNP, serving as acting chairman, senior vice chairman, and senior joint secretary.\n\nA leaked set of U.S. diplomatic cables described him as \"phenomenally corrupt.\"\n\nRahman went through an image makeover\n\nAfter the collapse of Hasina's government, the charges and convictions against Rahman were dropped, clearing the way for his return from exile.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, he sought to reshape his image, promising job creation, financial aid for poor families, greater freedom of speech, stronger law enforcement, and an end to corruption. His campaign cast him as a defender of democracy in a country long shaped by entrenched parties, military interventions and allegations of vote rigging.\n\nAfter Hasina's ouster, the country's interim leader Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus held a meeting with Rahman in London, an event that apparently led to his return to the country.\n\nHowever, his rise is expected to rankle many in Bangladesh, particularly those who took part in the uprising and wanted their country free of dynastic politics and the old political guard they blame for the country's problems.\n\nFeud with Hasina will be keenly watched\n\nThe Atlantic Council's Kugelman said a key test for Rahman will be how he treats Hasina's Awami League party, which has been accused of cracking down on the BNP in the past, including arrests of its senior leaders and party workers. Rahman's mother was arrested and imprisoned during Hasina's government.\n\nHasina has been in exile in India since August 2024, and a special tribunal in Dhaka sentenced her to death last year over crimes against humanity related to her crackdown that killed protesters during the uprising that ousted her. She denies all charges. Meanwhile, her party was barred from participating in the election, and thousands of its members remain in hiding due to fears of persecution.\n\n\"If Rahman leans on retribution, it shows the old politics haven't disappeared,\" said Kugelman. \"But a focus on unity would be an encouraging sign.\"\n\nFrom The Associated Press",

    "body": "Elections can be hard, and they usually tend to be messy in countries like Bangladesh, with its high population, relative poverty and low landmass. On the one hand, it's hard due to the zero sum game to which power is reduced in post-Colonial societies. Losing candidates don't just lose an election or vote count. There's a good chance they may even have to leave the area for a while at least. Opposition figures tend to be hounded and persecuted by state agencies simply for pursuing a different brand of politics to the government of the day.\n\nThat certainly was part of the political culture in Bangladesh, even widespread and rampant, in 2015. That is about when the likes of Nahid Islam, Nasiruddin Patwary, Mahfuj Alam, Asif Mahmud, and so many others, were just getting started in the student politics of the day, mostly centred around Dhaka University. Akhter Hossain is a year or two senior to them, and already in league with the movement of Nurul Huq Nur, who had emerged from underneath the shadow of the Chhatra League, the ruling Awami League's feared student wing that by then was the dominant force on every public university campus in the country, to lead his own students movement centred around the single issue of quotas in government jobs.\n\nIt was also around then that the High Court banned coverage of BNP vice-chairperson Tarique Rahman's speeches in print, electronic, and social media while he was considered \"absconding\" following corruption cases. At the time, Tarique was 8 years into a life of exile in the UK, and with AL wielding unprecedented power at the head of an administration growing increasingly authoritarian, one leading broadcast media, Ekushey TV, had been forced off air for carrying the livestream of a speech Tarique had delivered for activists back home via video conferencing.\n\nThe owner of the channel was sent to jail as well. Back in 2016, you simply couldn't have foreseen that ten years down the line, Bangladesh would have another election in which the Awami League would be the party banned; some of the principal actors would be drawn from among those students, and with Tarique Rahman very much the lead actor.\n\nYet that is the election we've just had, and hardly any questions have been raised over its legality or credibility.\n\nBNP secured 209 parliamentary seats, while Jamaat-e-Islami won 68, as the Election Commission disclosed the statistics of the unofficial election result of 297 constituencies on Friday afternoon.\n\nBesides, National Citizen Party-NCP settled victory in six constituencies, independent candidates in seven constituencies, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish in two, Islami Andolan Bangladesh in one, Bangladesh Jatiya Party-BJP (led by Andaleeve Rahman Partho) in one, Ganaodhikar Parishad in one, Ganasamhati Andolan in one and Khelafat Majlish in one parliamentary seat.\n\nEC Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed revealed the numbers at a press briefing in the city's Nirbachan Bhaban.\n\nHe said the average voter turnout was 59.4 percent (297 constituencies) in the parliamentary election, while the average voter turnout was 60.26 percent (299 constituencies) for the referendum.\n\nThe EC Secretary said the unofficial results of Chattogram-2 and 4 constituencies have been kept pending (following the court's decision).\n\nThe elections to Sherpur-3 was earlier cancelled following the death of a Jamaat candidate.\n\nAbout the referendum, he said 4,80,74,429 voters (68.05 percent of total casting votes) voted for 'Yes' option in the referendum ballots, while 2,25,65,627 voters (31.95 percent) for 'No' option to decide the fate of the implementation of the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Order 2025.\n\nJamaat would be far more impressive at this stage by showing maturity and strategic forbearance - accept the result, the verdict and take the opportunity to redefine the role of the opposition. It would come as a pleasant surprise to the entire nation, believe me, if they were able to find it in them, to reject the same, predictable response of losing parties in the past.\n\n'Credible, genuinely competitive': EU\n\nChief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) to Bangladesh Ivars Ijabs on Saturday described the national election as 'credible, hugely and genuinely competitive and pluralistic' but observed that there was lack of proper women's representation.\n\n\"Parliamentary elections were credible and competently managed, marking a pivotal step towards restoring democratic governance and rule of law,\" he told reporters at a city hotel.\n\nIjabs noted that for the first time since 2008, elections were genuinely competitive, conducted under a renewed legal framework that largely accords with international standards and with fundamental freedom broadly respected.\n\nHe, however, said sporadic, localised political violence and persistent fear of mob attacks, often triggered by manipulated online narratives, harmed the democratic process.\n\nRegarding the voter turnout, Ijabs said this is historically higher and lower and noted that it is shrinking everywhere and it is something concerning for all democracies.\n\nHe said the limited political space afforded to women undermined their equal participation but the EC worked independently and transparently, maintaining the confidence of stakeholders and upholding the integrity of the polls.\n\n\"Women candidates were, regrettably, almost absent from these elections,\" Ijabs said, noting that only four percent of the contestants were women, with BNP fielding 10 and NCP two candidates, while Jamaat and 30 other parties did not have any, evidencing a 'clear lack of political will' to advance women in national politics.\n\nHe also highlighted the vital role of citizen observers, fact-checkers, as well as youth and women activists in rebuilding public trust in elections, enhancing transparency, and helping voters to make informed choices.\n\nThe EU EOM observers noted that the election day was orderly, festive, and calm, while dedicated poll workers managed the opening, voting, and counting efficiently.\n\nThe presence of party agents at all stages of the process enhanced integrity, while regular updates on results tabulation at the local level by returning officers and by legacy media helped to maintain public confidence. Independent participation of persons with disabilities was not always ensured.\n\nThe absence of affirmative action measures still leaves indigenous communities and minorities underrepresented in the political arena.\n\n\"It is time to abandon the old practices that no longer reflect the growing maturity of Bangladesh's democracy and to chart a new course promoting independent institutions, human rights and accountability,\" said Ijabs.\n\nCommonwealth: Stay united\n\nChairperson of the Commonwealth Observer Group Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on Saturday described Bangladesh's 13th parliamentary election as 'acceptable, transparent, peaceful and orderly'.\n\nHe commended the peaceful conduct of Bangladesh's parliamentary elections and the July Charter referendum, while highlighting areas where further progress on 'inclusion and accessibility' could strengthen the democratic process.\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh have exercised their democratic rights to seek the fulfillment of their aspirations. We encourage them to be magnanimous and united in their shared democratic future,\" said the former President of Ghana while presenting the Group's interim statement on Thursday's national election and referendum at a city hotel.\n\nLooking ahead to the next election cycle, he encouraged the Bangladesh Election Commission to conduct a post-election review, including of all observer recommendations, as is consistent with good practice.\n\nThe final report, which will set out the full findings on the process and recommendations in greater detail, will be submitted to the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Shirley Botchwey, and thereafter shared with the government of Bangladesh, the Election Commission, political parties, and Commonwealth governments and then made public.\n\nThe Chairperson acknowledged the context in which the elections were conducted, including the significant political developments following the July Uprising of 2024, as well as decisions affecting the participation of some political parties.\n\nWhile the Group noted isolated reports of post-election tensions, it encouraged all stakeholders to continue to promote calm and peaceful conduct during the post-election period, and to resolve any disputes through the relevant legal channels.\n\nThe Observer Group praised the vibrant media coverage, noting its important role in informing citizens and encouraging political debate.\n\nAt the same time, it raised concerns about online misinformation, cyber harassment and hate speech, which continue to affect public discourse.\n\nThe participation of women and youths emerged as areas requiring greater attention.\n\nWomen accounted for only 4 percent of candidates, with seven elected, while youth activism did not always translate into formal influence within political party structures, he said.\n\nAccording to the Group's statement, despite isolated pre- and post-election tensions, polling officials, security personnel and election agents generally carried out their duties with professionalism.\n\nThe Group also noted that officials assisted elderly voters and persons with disabilities.\n\nHowever, many polling stations remained inaccessible, particularly on upper floors, and lacked provisions for other forms of disability.\n\nOn the referendum, the Group said it recognises the Charter as a response to multiple and urgent demands for reform. \"At the same time, some stakeholders expressed concerns as to whether the referendum process was sufficiently consultative and clearly communicated.\"\n\nThe Group encouraged all stakeholders to maintain calm during the post-election period and consider the recommendations that will be outlined in its forthcoming final report. The Commonwealth Observer Group is an independent body that will make recommendations to the Commonwealth Secretary-General.\n\nIt was constituted by the Commonwealth Secretary-General. Twelve experts, drawn from the fields of politics, law, media, gender, and election administration from several Commonwealth regions, were part of the group. The Commonwealth admitted Bangladesh as its 34th member on 18 April 1972, after its independence in December 1971. This is the fourth time that a Commonwealth Observer Group has been deployed.\n\nUN stresses Unity\n\nThe United Nations (UN) also congratulated Bangladesh on holding the elections and a referendum and reiterated its commitment to supporting Bangladesh in its effort to build a peaceful and prosperous future.\n\n\"The Secretary-General (António Guterres), as he does often after many elections, he encourages all political stakeholders to build on the momentum so as to strengthen national cohesion, uphold the democratic norms and the rule of law,\" Spokesman for the Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric told reporters at a regular briefing at the UN headquarters on Friday (February 13).\n\nThe UN chief encouraged all political stakeholders to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by all, and protecting minorities as the country advances its transition and pursues inclusive and sustainable reform.\n\n\"Look, we were not observers to the elections, so it's not for us to give a grade, so to speak, if that's the intent of your question. What I can tell you is that we, of course, congratulate the people of Bangladesh for the holding of the elections, legislative elections and a referendum,\" said the spokesman while responding to a question.\n\n\"But we continue to be committed to supporting Bangladesh in its effort to build a peaceful and prosperous future,\" he added.\n\nIRI focuses on road ahead\n\nThe International Republican Institute (IRI), a Washington-based organisation dedicated to advancing democracy and freedom globally, on Saturday said the new government in Bangladesh, to be formed within days, should swiftly implement the July Charter reforms and ensure institutions deliver for all Bangladeshis.\n\n\"Now that the election is over, the hard work of governing lies ahead and the enthusiasm of the Bangladeshi people needs to be translated into action,\" said David Dreier, the IRI delegation leader and former United States Congressman (R-CA).\n\nSignificant underrepresentation of women, along with ethnic and religious minorities, among candidates remains a serious concern, said the IRI.\n\nThe IRI deployed a delegation of international election observers to Dhaka from February 9 to 13, 2026, to assess the conduct of the February 12 elections.\n\nThe election marks an inflection point for a country navigating a complex democratic transition following the July 2024 uprising that ended over 15 years of Awami League rule, IRI said.\n\nThe delegation met with a broad range of stakeholders, including the Bangladesh Election Commission, political parties, interim government officials, and civic organizations from across the Bangladeshi political spectrum, to assess the electoral environment and prospects for democratic renewal.\n\n\"Security forces and the Election Commission performed admirably. After years of authoritarian rule, Election Day was mostly peaceful and incident-free. Given the historical context, that is a big step forward for Bangladesh,\" said Dreier.\n\nWhile election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile, IRI said.\n\nIn the immediate post-election period, the delegation encourages political candidates to use legal channels to resolve disputes.\n\nThe delegation will continue to monitor the post-election process and issue a final, comprehensive report that includes in-depth analysis and recommendations to improve future elections.\n\nAdditional reporting by AKM Moinuddin",

    "body": "Finally the people of Bangladesh have spoken, and they have delivered their verdict resoundingly in favour of the BNP and Tarique Rahman to take the reins of this broken nation, to pick up the pieces of its broken republic after an age of authoritarianism, and to try and take it forward. A decisive and resounding result is the best result the country could have delivered, and that is what they have done, in favour of the most sensible option on its table.\n\nEven a week ago, there was an apparent panic in Dhaka's elite circles and chatterati, regarding the Islamist wave represented by the resurgent Jamaat-e-Islami, and the alliance they formed with the young revolutionaries who brought down the Awami League. Those fears have all proved to be unfounded. To say nothing of the fears that the election would not even be held. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus had promised the best, and most beautiful election in Bangladesh's history. With no one killed on Election Day for the first time in 35 years I believe it is safe to say that he got closer to that objective than almost anyone could have expected. He and his team of advisers can now ride off into the sunset with their heads held high.\n\nAnd Bangladesh's vaunted army, which must be fatigued after spending the longest time aiding the civil administration with special magistracy powers, can finally return to the barracks. Its presence on Election Day has come in for particular praise from the public.\n\nTo the extent that this election was a product of the July Uprising, the result was expected to reflect it. While the Hasina government was toppled through that monumental movement, the interim government was sworn in on the same constitution that bore the ousted dictator's imprint all over it. While foreign newspapers and media outlets regularly describe it as a revolution, among Bangladeshis themselves, there is notable hesitation and hair-splitting, and an internal debate that seems to have settled on it being an uprising - not a revolution. These tendencies all speak to that aversion to radical upheaval, and the search for a safe harbour, over new pastures.\n\nIn this situation, the BNP emerged in many people's eyes as the most safe and pragmatic option. That is what the leadership style of their new chairman reflects. Since arriving back in Bangladesh on December 25, Tarique has been the centre of attention, treated almost as a godsend by liberal sections of society fearing an Islamist takeover. He has not hesitated in pushing his daughter Zaima into the spotlight, having her accompany him during important meetings, for example with the Indian foreign minister, Subramaniam Jaishankar, when he came to attend the funeral of the BNP's late chairperson, the thrice-former premier, and of course Tarique's mother, Begum Khaleda Zia. The massive crowds greeting Tarique on his return, followed by huge turnout at Begum Zia's subsequent funeral, served to shift the momentum of the election back decisively towards the BNP, from a point where it seemed to be slipping away.\n\nHe has made all the right noises so far, but now he must govern in the style to reflect that too. The BNP's incoming administration will need to address a raft of challenges, from weak institutions to a sluggish economy heavily dependent on garment exports and remittances to the growing effects of climate change in one of the world's most densely populated countries. It will also need to navigate tricky foreign policy issues, particularly relations with India, the implications of the intensifying US-China rivalry and the lack of progress toward resolving the status of more than one million Rohingya refugees.\n\nBeyond job opportunities, Bangladeshi young people want to see their country run with greater integrity and the benefits of growth distributed more broadly. Any stumble in seeing through reforms would risk reinforcing a perception that the political change they were promised has been cosmetic. The party of Zia has been presented with an incredible opportunity to correct past mistakes, and overhaul the public's perception from the term they served in 2001-6. Let us hope they take it.\n\nEnayetullah Khan Editor-in-Chief, United News of Bangladesh (UNB) and Dhaka Courier",

    "body": "The Jamaat-e-Islami-led 11-party electoral alliance on Sunday demanded that the Election Commission (EC) recount votes in 32 constituencies, alleging manipulation during the counting and result publication of the national election. \"Particularly 32 constituencies have been identified. We have been defeated here by a small margin of votes. This is the statement of our candidates....we have submitted the list of such constituencies to the commission and asked them to recount the votes there,\" said Jamaat Assistant Secretary General AHM Hamidur Rahman Azad.\n\nHe said this while briefing reporters after a meeting between the delegation and the EC in the city's Nirbachan Bhaban. Four election commissioners Abdur Rahmanel Masud, Tahmida Ahmad, Anwarul Islam Sarker and Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah were present in the meeting. Azad said there are allegations that the agents of their candidates were forcibly removed from many polling stations during the counting of votes and even those who were present in the counting room faced threats and intimidation when they tried to complain about any irregularities.\n\nBreaking tradition, the cabinet swearing-in will not be held at Bangabhaban's Darbar Hall. For the first time, an incoming government will begin its journey under the open sky, with cabinet members taking the oath of office at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad on Tuesday afternoon. The newly elected MPs will also be sworn in at the same venue in the morning. Multiple sources from the Chief Adviser's Office, Cabinet Division, and Parliament Secretariat confirmed the matter.\n\nTraditionally, MPs are sworn in at the parliament's oath room and the cabinet at Bangabhaban's Darbar Hall. However, this time, both ceremonies will be held at the parliament's south plaza, as preferred by the incoming government, officials said. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath to the prime minister and cabinet members. While either Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin or Chief Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury will administer the oath to the MPs.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) congratulated the people of Bangladesh on holding the parliamentary elections and referendum, urging all political actors to strengthen national cohesion and uphold democratic norms and human rights. In a message issued by the UN, Secretary-General António Guterres extended congratulations to the people of Bangladesh for holding of the elections and referendum. The UN chief encouraged all political stakeholders to build on the momentum generated by the polls to reinforce national unity and democratic practices.\n\nGuterres underscored the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights by all citizens, including the protection of minorities. He expressed hope that Bangladesh would continue advancing its democratic transition while pursuing inclusive and sustainable reforms in the days ahead. The United Nations reiterated its support for Bangladesh's continued efforts toward strengthening democratic institutions and fostering social cohesion.\n\nBangladesh's premier literary event, Ekushey Book Fair, is set to open later this month amid mounting opposition from a large section of mainstream publishers who warn that holding the fair during Ramadan could inflict heavy financial losses on the industry. Bangla Academy has confirmed that the Amar Ekushey Book Fair 2026 will begin on February 20, even as more than 300 publishers have threatened to boycott the event if the schedule is not reconsidered. To facilitate confirmation of stall and pavilion allotments, Bangla Academy earlier extended the payment deadline from February 9 to February 11. According to organisers, a total of 662 stalls have been allotted this year, 133 more than in 2025.\n\nDr Md Selim Reza, member secretary of the Amar Ekushey Book Fair 2026 Organising Committee, told UNB that preparations are already well underway. \"The lottery for allocation of stalls and pavilions was completed on Tuesday night. Allocation has already been finalised. Now publishers can start organising their allotted spaces,\" he said.",

    "body": "The recently concluded US Bangladesh Agreement on Reciprocal Trade (USTA) is an important milestone in bilateral relations.\n\nIt signals Bangladesh's rising economic relevance and the United States' intent to engage more deeply with South Asia's emerging economies. Yet, as with all modern trade agreements, its true impact lies not only in tariffs, but in the strategic choices it shapes.\n\nThe best of the USTA is clear. Improved access to the US market enhances predictability for Bangladeshi exporters at a time when global supply chains are being reconfigured. The agreement also reflects strategic recognition: Bangladesh is no longer seen merely as a low cost manufacturing base, but as a consequential economy in a multipolar world. Such recognition strengthens investor confidence and diplomatic leverage.\n\nThe agreement also expands short term energy options. Facilitating imports of US LNG adds supply diversity and bargaining power, particularly during periods of global energy stress. Optionality itself has value.\n\nHowever, the risks deserve equal attention.\n\nFirst, the USTA embeds a range of non trade commitments on governance, labour, compliance, and regulatory practices. While many reforms are desirable, reform must be locally designed and sequenced.\n\nExternally driven, rigid conditionalities risk narrowing policy space and creating uncertainty, especially for a developing economy navigating political transitions. Reform should strengthen sovereignty, not dilute it.\n\nSecond, energy cooperation under the USTA is heavily weighted toward imports, not energy independence. True energy security is not achieved at the import terminal alone.\n\nBangladesh's long-term resilience depends on diversified sourcing, renewables, regional power trade, and critically, the right and ability to explore its own offshore gas resources in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe agreement is silent on upstream exploration, technology transfer, or risk sharing. A partnership that sells fuel without supporting production risks creating long term dependence.\n\nThird, there is limited clarity on taxation.\n\nThe USTA does not automatically make US imports tax exempt. Even where customs duties are reduced or eliminated, domestic import stage taxes often continue to apply unless explicitly waived under national law.\n\nThis ambiguity is particularly relevant for strategic imports such as LNG, where fiscal uncertainty complicates long term pricing, contracts, and energy affordability.\n\nThe USTA should therefore be viewed as a framework, not a final destination. It works best when it expands Bangladesh's choices and worst when it narrows them.\n\nTrade liberalisation must be complemented by strong domestic policy: clear tax regimes, assertive offshore exploration, and diversified energy strategy.\n\nBangladesh's future lies in engagement without dependence, reform without surrender, and trade without compromising strategic autonomy.\n\nIf implemented wisely, the USTA can support that future. If not, the risk is simple: short-term access gained at the cost of long term resilience.\n\nMuhammed Aziz Khan is the chairman of Summit Group.",

    "title": "Zarah Sultana: Palantir has no place in UK public services",
    "body": "From ICE to Gaza, Palantir is complicit in violent US hegemony. Why do we keep giving it contracts?\n\nPalantir is not a normal software company. It was founded with an explicit mission which remains at the heart of its operations today: to maintain US global domination.\n\nWe know exactly what that means. Endless wars. Drone strikes. A vast machinery of surveillance and occupation stretching from Afghanistan and Iraq to the ongoing genocide in Gaza. A world in which Washington's military reach grows ever longer, and the UK prime minister increasingly behaves less like an ally and more like a compliant poodle, nodding along to whatever the White House demands.\n\nOn an investor call last February, Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp, said he was \"super proud\" of what his company does. Perhaps he was referring to Palantir's role in enabling ICE to target migrant communities and tear families apart. Or perhaps he meant reports that its technology has allegedly helped the Israeli military generate \"kill lists\" - a practice condemned by human-rights organisations for contributing to the mass civilian casualties we are witnessing in Gaza.\n\nWhatever Karp had in mind, Keir Starmer did not appear troubled. Later that month, he flew to Palantir's Washington headquarters to kiss the ring of a corporation deeply embedded in the US military and intelligence infrastructure. He did so alongside his then US ambassador, Peter Mandelson - close friend of the late notorious paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - whose lobbying firm, Global Counsel, has long represented Palantir.\n\nSince then, this government has only tightened its embrace. Building on ties established under the Conservatives, Labour is embedding a company accused by campaigners of facilitating human-rights violations deeper and deeper into our public life. Palantir already operates inside the NHS and across Whitehall - particularly within the Ministry of Defence - pulling Britain further into the slipstream of US military priorities and the worst excesses of the American security state.\n\nNo company so entangled in foreign military operations and border policing should be anywhere near our public services. Full stop.\n\nExperts and civil liberties campaigners have repeatedly warned about Palantir's expanding access to sensitive British data, including NHS medical records - data that the US private healthcare industry is eager to exploit. The risks to privacy, accountability and democracy are profound.\n\nYet, as with the Tories before them, nothing is off the table for this Labour government when it comes to carving up public services for multinational corporations and their lobbyists. Their deference to Washington is now so complete that they barely bother to conceal their enthusiasm for cosying up to Donald Trump's network of tech-bro oligarchs. We saw this clearly last summer, when Starmer rolled out the red carpet for Palantir and signed off a £1.5bn \"strategic partnership\" - at the very moment public services across Britain were collapsing under austerity. It begs the question: who, exactly, is Starmer unwilling to roll out the blood-stained red carpet for?\n\nAcross the country, libraries are closing. Swimming pools are shutting. Councils are going bankrupt. But somehow, there is always money available for a CIA-funded contractor at the heart of the US war machine.\n\nAnd it does not stop at Westminster. Palantir's tentacles are already extending into our communities. In my constituency of Coventry, the Labour-run council awarded the company a £500,000 contract to develop an AI tool for children's services. Yes - a firm implicated in military targeting abroad and the kidnapping of children as young as five in the US, was hired to shape how we safeguard children here at home.\n\nWe fought back. Led by Your Party councillor, Grace Lewis, and backed by our unions and community campaigners, we forced that contract into review. And let me be absolutely clear: we will not stop until it is cancelled entirely.\n\nBut this fight is bigger than one contract or one city. We need a politics that draws a clear line: Palantir - and every corporation that profits from occupation, surveillance, genocide and war - has no place in our society and should never again receive a penny of public money.\n\nThis country needs a party willing to resist a government that bows to Washington, sells off our public services and hands power to war-profiteering tech giants. That party is Your Party.\n\nAnd our fight is only just beginning.\n\nFrom openDemocracy",

    "body": "Five Generation Z politicians, born between 1997 and 2012, are set to enter the Jatiya Sangsad following their victories in the 13th parliamentary election.\n\nWhile at least 23 Gen Z candidates contested, only five managed to secure seats. Four of them represent the National Citizen Party (NCP), a platform that emerged from the July 2024 mass uprising, while one hails from the Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish.\n\nAccording to Election Commission (EC) records, 25 Gen Z aspirants initially submitted nomination papers, with two later withdrawing. The NCP fielded seven candidates, while Gono Odhikar Parishad and Insaniyat Biplob Bangladesh nominated three each. The Socialist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist) put forward two candidates, while other parties - including AB Party, Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Nationalist Front, and Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish - nominated one each.\n\nThe successful Gen Z candidates are:\n\nMd Nahid Islam, 27, NCP Convener and a leader of the 2024 uprising;\n\nAkhtar Hossain, 28, NCP Member Secretary;\n\nHasnat Abdullah, 27, NCP Chief Organiser (Southern region);\n\nAbdul Hannan Masud, 26, NCP Senior Joint Chief Coordinator; and\n\nSaid Uddin Ahmad Hanzala, 28, representing Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish.\n\nNahid Islam won Dhaka-11 by a margin of around 2,000 votes, polling 93,872 votes against his nearest rival's 91,833. Hasnat Abdullah drew attention with a decisive victory in Cumilla-4 (Debidwar), defeating Md A Jasim Uddin of Gono Odhikar Parishad, who received 49,644 votes.\n\nIn Rangpur-4 (Pirgachha-Kaunia), Akhtar Hossain secured 149,966 votes, outpacing Emdadul Haque Bharosa, who obtained 140,564. Abdul Hannan Masud triumphed in Noakhali-6 with 90,118 votes, defeating BNP candidate Mahbubur Rahman Shamim by 26,746 votes. Said Uddin Ahmad Hanzala claimed Madaripur-1 (Shibchar) in a narrow contest, winning 64,909 votes and edging past BNP nominee Nadira Akter by just 385 votes.\n\nMasud, born on 1 January 2000, is now 26 years and one month old, making him the youngest MP in the 13th National Parliament.\n\nAmong the Gen Z candidates who were defeated, Sarjis Alam, NCP Chief Organiser (Northern region), attracted attention after losing Panchagarh-1 by approximately 8,000 votes to Barrister Naushad Zamir.\n\nThese new entrants mark a generational shift in Bangladeshi politics, signalling the rising influence of young leaders in shaping the country's parliamentary landscape.",

    "body": "For decades, Bangladesh has celebrated the rise of women in politics, but in practice, their presence in parliament is shrinking. Despite policy initiatives and growing public discourse on gender equality, the 13th national parliamentary election saw only seven women directly elected, a stark decline from previous terms.\n\nThis marks a drop from 19 directly elected female MPs in the 12th parliamentary elections of 2024 and 22 in the 11th elections of 2018, which remains the highest number of directly elected women in the country's history.\n\nSources indicate that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is set to form the government for the fourth consecutive term with an absolute majority. Among the victorious candidates, six women belong to the BNP.\n\nThey are: Afroza Khanam Rita from Manikganj-3, Israt Sultana Elen Bhutto from Jhalokathi-2, Tahsina Rushdi Luna from Sylhet-2, Shama Obaid Islam from Faridpur-2, Nayab Yusuf Ahmed Islam from Faridpur-3, and Farzana Sharmin Putul from Natore-1. In addition, Barrister Rumeen Farhana, a former BNP MP, was elected as an independent candidate from Brahmanbaria-2.\n\nAccording to the Election Commission, 30 out of the 51 political parties that contested the 13th parliamentary election did not field a single female candidate. Out of 1,991 candidates in the election, only 65 were women. By comparison, the 2024 elections saw a record 94 female candidates competing, while the 2018 elections had 69 female contenders.\n\nHistorical records from the Secretariat of Parliament show that women's representation in Bangladesh's legislature has fluctuated over time. In the first national elections on 7 March 1973, 15 women were represented through reserved seats. By the second parliament in 1979, this number rose to 30, including Syeda Razia Faiz, who was the country's first and only directly elected female MP from Khulna-14.\n\nIn the third parliament of 1986, only five women were directly elected, followed by four in the fourth parliament of 1988. Subsequent parliaments saw modest gains: five out of 39 in the fifth parliament of 1991, eight out of 36 in the seventh parliament of 1996, six out of 38 in the eighth parliament of 2001, 19 out of 59 in the ninth parliament of 2008, and 18 out of 29 in the tenth parliament of 2014.\n\nA review of parliamentary records, electoral documents, and legislative notices suggests that, although female leadership has grown gradually in the country, it has not translated into substantial contributions to lawmaking.\n\nSome observers still regard women as ornamental in parliament, while others argue for their critical role in strengthening democracy. Experts note that while the number of reserved seats has increased over time, the qualitative leadership of women MPs has not necessarily improved. The number of directly elected female MPs is declining, yet enhancing women's political empowerment remains essential for the consolidation of democracy.",

With the new legislature set to assume office, questions about the state-funded benefits provided to MPs have resurfaced.\n\nUnder the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Allowances) Order, 1973 and subsequent amendments, lawmakers are entitled to a comprehensive package of financial benefits and institutional support designed to facilitate their legislative and constituency duties.\n\nMonthly salary and allowances\n\nAn MP receives a basic monthly salary of Tk 55,000. In addition, they are entitled to several allowances, including:\n\nConstituency allowance: Tk 12,500\n\nEntertainment allowance: Tk 5,000\n\nTransport allowance: Tk 70,000 (covering fuel, vehicle maintenance and driver's salary)\n\nOffice expense allowance: Tk 15,000\n\nLaundry allowance: Tk 1,500\n\nMiscellaneous allowance: Tk 6,000\n\nTogether, these components significantly increase the monthly remuneration beyond the basic salary.\n\nVehicle facilities\n\nMPs are entitled to import a car, jeep or microbus duty-free, exempt from customs duties, VAT and other taxes. After five years, they may import a new vehicle under the same facility.\n\nTravel benefits\n\nFor official travel by air, rail or water, MPs are entitled to 1.5 times the highest class fare.

    "body": "In a speech marked as much by triumph as by caution, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman on Saturday called for national unity to build what he described as a \"safe, humane and democratic Bangladesh\", following his party's sweeping victory in the 13th national election.\n\nAddressing journalists at a packed press conference in a city hotel, Tarique framed the result not merely as a partisan success but as a broader democratic milestone. \"This victory belongs to Bangladesh, to democracy and to the pro-democracy people,\" he declared in his opening remarks. Later, striking an even more emphatic tone, he added: \"We all are free from today.\"\n\nAccording to unofficial results, the BNP secured 209 seats in the parliamentary polls, handing the party a landslide win. Tarique himself was elected from both Dhaka-17 and Bogura-6 constituencies. Senior BNP leaders, including members of the party's standing committee, as well as local and foreign journalists, attended the event.\n\nA victory beyond party lines\n\nTarique Rahman congratulated all 51 political parties that participated in the election, describing political parties as the \"beacons of democracy\" in a democratic state. The outcome represents \"not just a triumph for the BNP, but also a victory for Bangladesh and for pro-democracy forces across the country\", he said.\n\nThanking voters for overcoming what he termed \"all obstacles\", he said their \"spontaneous participation\" had paved the way for restoring democratic accountability. \"With your spontaneous participation, after more than a decade and a half, a parliament and government accountable to the people through direct votes are set to be established,\" he said.\n\nAt the heart of his address was a call for unity. \"National unity is strength, division is weakness,\" Tarique said, urging parties to rise above political differences. \"Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country we are one.\"\n\nHe stressed that both government and opposition would need to play responsible roles in institutionalising democracy, adding that constructive and democratic opinions from all sides would be vital in state governance.\n\nGuarding against instability\n\nEven amid celebration, Tarique struck a sober note about the challenges ahead. Referring to the country's \"fragile economic and constitutional structures\" and a \"collapsed law and order situation\", he sought cooperation from all quarters in rebuilding state institutions.\n\nHe warned against any relapse into authoritarianism. Unity, he said, was essential to ensure that \"no force can ever again impose fascism or turn the country into a subservient state\".\n\nLaw and order featured prominently in his remarks. Stressing the importance of the rule of law, Tarique said peace and order must be maintained \"at any cost\". \"Regardless of party affiliation, religion, caste or opinion, attacks by the powerful on the weak will not be accepted under any pretext. Law will be applied equally to every citizen in accordance with due process,\" he said.\n\nHe also cautioned supporters against turning electoral rivalries into vengeance. \"Misunderstandings may have arisen during competition in the field, but such differences must not turn into revenge or retaliation.\"\n\nAddressing party activists directly, Tarique expressed gratitude for their years of sacrifice but urged restraint and responsibility. \"Your biggest responsibility now is to build the country,\" he said.\n\nReform pledges and the July Charter\n\nReaffirming the BNP's reform agenda, Tarique said the party remained committed to implementing the July Charter. He noted that the BNP had presented a state reform outline and later finalised a 31-point agenda through consultations with democratic parties and citizens nationwide.\n\n\"We are committed to gradually implementing every promise made to the people,\" he said, positioning the programme as a roadmap for structural reform.\n\nAcknowledgements and tributes\n\nIn a gesture of institutional recognition, Tarique thanked the interim government, the Election Commission, public administration officials, law enforcement agencies, the armed forces and polling officials for organising what he described as a fair election.\n\nHe also paid tribute to former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, saying her absence at what he termed a \"moment of national joy\" was deeply felt. \"She fought uncompromisingly against fascism, never yielding to autocracy. On issues concerning the country and the people, she remained steadfast,\" he said.\n\nTarique prayed for the departed souls of those who had laid down their lives for democracy from the 1971 Liberation War to 2024 and wished a speedy recovery to those injured in the July uprising.\n\nIn closing, he extended his appeal beyond national borders, seeking cooperation from expatriate Bangladeshis and democratic communities worldwide in building a \"safe, humane and democratic Bangladesh\".\n\nFor the BNP leader, the landslide win is both an end and a beginning: the culmination of a long political struggle and, in his words, the start of a collective effort to rebuild institutions, restore accountability and redefine the country's democratic future.",

    "body": "Denis Mukwege. Photo: Collected\n\nMUNICH, Germany, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Nobel Prize-winning Congolese\n\ndoctor Denis Mukwege on Sunday cast doubt over the longevity of the latest\n\npotential ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern conflict\n\nwith the Rwanda-backed M23 militia.\n\nWhile the Congolese government proposed freezing the frontlines on Friday as\n\na step towards a lasting halt to the fighting, the M23 replied by criticising\n\nthe DRC's \"delaying tactics and attempts at manipulation\".\n\n\"I think it risks looking like a truce, and we don't know how long this truce\n\nwill last. We have seen many ceasefires in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nthat have not lasted long,\" Mukwege told AFP in an interview on the sidelines\n\nof the Munich security conference.\n\n\"We have had non-stop wars for 30 years, and each time there is a ceasefire,\n\nthe warring parties end up just breaking it,\" said the renowned\n\ngynaecologist, who won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for his lifetime of\n\nactivism against the use of rape in wartime.\n\nHalf a dozen ceasefires have been brokered and broken in short order in the\n\nDRC's resource-rich east, in the crosshairs of the M23 since the Rwanda-\n\nbacked armed group's resurgence in 2021.\n\nAfter violence flared up following the M23's capture of the key cities of\n\nGoma and Bukavu at the beginning of 2025, both the United States and Qatar\n\nsought to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table.\n\nWhile those efforts led to the signing of two separate agreements, neither\n\nhas succeeded in halting the fighting on the ground.\n\nCritics have meanwhile accused the Congolese government of selling off the\n\ncountry's vast mineral wealth to Washington as part of the peace process, an\n\nallegation the DRC's mining minister denied on Wednesday.\n\n\"We have seen the limits of these ceasefires,\" said Mukwege, who has operated\n\non thousands of women subjected to the sexual violence that has been a\n\nfeature of the DRC's long-running conflicts.\n\n\"We hope that this one will be the right one, because in any case the\n\nsuffering of the Congolese people is enormous,\" he added.\n\nMukwege, a frequent critic of the government in Kinshasa, argued that the DRC\n\nneeds a \"national dialogue\" to resolve the corruption-riddled country's\n\n\"governance problem\".\n\n\"Instead of taking short-term solutions, we really need to look at the issue\n\nas a whole,\" he said.\n\n\"If the Congo is suffering today, it is simply because there is poor\n\ngovernance. And so, if we had good governance, the Congo should normally be\n\nable to protect its population and take charge of its minerals, which are\n\ncurrently being exploited by all the vultures around the Democratic Republic\n\nof Congo.\"",

    "body": "GAZA CITY, Palestinian Territories, Feb 15, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - Gaza's civil\n\ndefence agency reported that Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people since\n\ndawn on Sunday, while a military official said the attacks were in response\n\nto ceasefire violations.\n\nDespite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month,\n\nviolence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas\n\nblaming each other for violating the agreement.\n\nThe civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas\n\nauthorities, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza\n\nand another targeted an area in the south.\n\nFive people were killed and several injured when an air strike targeted a\n\ntent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in\n\na statement.\n\nFive more were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike\n\nin the southern city of Khan Yunis, the agency said, adding that one more was\n\nkilled in Israeli shelling in Gaza City.\n\nIt also said Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza.\n\nThe Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed receiving at least seven bodies.\n\n\"Israel doesn't understand ceasefires or truces,\" said Osama Abu Askar, who\n\nlost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.\n\nHe said the people were killed as they slept.\n\n- Funeral prayers -\n\n\"We've been living under a truce for months, and they've still targeted us.\n\nIsrael operates on this principle -- saying one thing and doing another,\"\n\nAskar told AFP.\n\nDozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the\n\nbodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds.\n\nMen and women prayed before the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital\n\ncompound.\n\nA military official said Israel attacked in response to Hamas violations of\n\nthe ceasefire.\n\n\"The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who\n\ntook cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF troops,\n\nlikely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area,\" the official\n\nsaid.\n\n\"Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed, is an\n\nexplicit ceasefire violation, and demonstrates how Hamas systematically\n\nviolates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, Israeli\n\ntroops withdrew to behind a so-called \"Yellow Line\", although they still\n\ncontrol more than half of the Palestinian territory.\n\nHamas spokesman Hazem Qassem in a statement on Sunday accused the Israeli\n\nmilitary of violating the ceasefire.\n\n\"Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the\n\nceasefire agreement,\" Qassem said.\n\nGaza's health ministry, which operates under Hamas authorities, says at least\n\n601 people have been killed since the truce began.\n\nIsrael says at least four of its soldiers have been killed in the same\n\nperiod.\n\n- Media restrictions -\n\nMedia restrictions and limited access to Gaza have prevented AFP and other\n\nnews organisations from independently verifying casualty figures or freely\n\ncovering the fighting.\n\nInternational medical charity Doctors Without Borders, meanwhile, said it had\n\nsuspended its \"non-critical\" work at Nasser Hospital after staff reported\n\nseeing gunmen there and weapons being moved.\n\n\"We don't know who these armed men are or if they belong to any group,\" MSF\n\ntold AFP.\n\nDuring the war, the Israeli military accused Hamas of using hospitals as\n\ncommand centres to attack its forces.\n\n\"The obvious question is: where was MSF until now?\" COGAT, the Israeli\n\ndefence ministry body for Palestinian civilian affairs, wrote on X.\n\n\"If MSF now acknowledges Hamas's deep presence in a hospital they work in,\n\nwhy has it repeatedly refused basic transparency -- such as submitting staff\n\nlists -- to ensure its organisation has not been infiltrated by Hamas\n\noperatives?\"\n\nIsrael has said it will terminate all MSF activities in Gaza and the occupied\n\nWest Bank from March 1 after the charity did not provide names of its\n\nPalestinian staff.\n\nMSF says it did not do so because Israel failed to give assurances the staff\n\nwould be safe.",
